1. What is Firewall?
    A firewall is a security system—either hardware, software, or both—that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
    Traffic Filtering:
        --It examines packets based on IP address, port, or protocol.
        --Blocks or allows traffic depending on rules set by the network admin.

2. Types of firewall.
    1. Packet-Filtering Firewall
        Works at: Network Layer (Layer 3)
        How it works: Checks each packet's source IP, destination IP, port number, and protocol
        Use Case: Basic filtering in routers or gateways
    
    2. Stateful Inspection Firewall
        Works at: Network & Transport Layers (Layer 3 & 4)
        How it works: Keeps track of active connections and allows packets only if they belong to a valid session
    
    3. Proxy Firewall (Application-Level Gateway)
        Use Case: Web filters, secure email gateways, content monitoring

    4. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
        Works at: All Layers (especially Layer 7)
        How it works: Combines stateful inspection, deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, malware protection, and more
        Use Case: Modern enterprises with complex threats
    
    5. Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewall
        Works at: Network Layer
        How it works: Hides internal IP addresses from the public, only allows requests initiated from inside
        Use Case: Home and office networks with private IP addressing

3.  What Are the Possible Attacks on Firewalls?
     Common Attacks on Firewalls:
        IP Spoofing
            Attacker forges a trusted IP address to trick the firewall into allowing traffic.

        Port Scanning
            Used to probe for open ports and detect vulnerabilities in firewall rules.

        Packet Fragmentation Attack
            Sends split-up malicious packets to evade detection (e.g., IDS/IPS inside NGFW).

        Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
            Floods the firewall with traffic, overwhelming resources and disrupting service.

        Tunneling Attacks
            Malicious data is hidden inside allowed protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS) to sneak through.

        Misconfiguration Exploits
            Attackers exploit poorly set rules or open ports left unguarded.

        Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
            If firewall doesn't enforce encryption, attackers can intercept/modifying traffic.

        Backdoor or Trojan Access
            Malware inside the internal network initiates outbound connections, bypassing inbound firewall rules.
        
        🛡️ How to Defend Against These:
            Enable stateful inspection
            Use Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
            Regularly audit and update rules
            Block unused ports and monitor traffic patterns
            Deploy Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) with deep inspection

4. What Are Basic Network Attacks?
    Basic network attacks are attempts to disrupt, steal, or gain unauthorized access to data or systems over a network. 

    🔥 Common Basic Network Attacks:
    Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS)
        Floods a server/network with traffic to make it unavailable.
        DDoS uses multiple systems to launch the attack.
    
    Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
        Attacker intercepts communication between two parties to eavesdrop or alter data.
        Common in insecure Wi-Fi.
    
    IP Spoofing
        Sending packets from a fake (spoofed) IP address to bypass security filters.
    
    MAC Spoofing
        Changes the MAC address of a device to impersonate another machine.
    
    Packet Sniffing
        Captures network packets using tools like Wireshark to read unencrypted data.
    
    Brute Force Attack
        Repeatedly tries usernames/passwords to gain access.
    
    Phishing (via Network)
        Uses emails or messages over the network to trick users into giving credentials or downloading malware.

5.  What is Denial of Service (DoS) and How Can It Be Prevented?
    A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to make a system, service, or network unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic or resource requests.
    If it comes from multiple systems, it's called a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

    The attacker floods a server or network with massive amounts of:Traffic (e.g., SYN floods, HTTP requests). The target becomes overloaded, casuing slowness, crashes, unavailibity to legitimate user

    🛡️ DoS/DDoS Prevention Techniques:
        Rate Limiting:
            Limit the number of requests a user/IP can make.

        Firewalls & Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):
            Block suspicious traffic patterns.

        Traffic Filtering with Anti-DDoS Services:
            Use services like Cloudflare, AWS Shield, Akamai to absorb and filter attacks.

        CDNs (Content Delivery Networks):
            Distribute traffic across multiple nodes to reduce load on a single server.

        Network Redundancy:
            Use load balancers and failover systems to spread traffic and prevent bottlenecks.

        Blackhole Routing (Sinkholing):
            Route attack traffic to a “black hole” (non-existent server) to protect the real one.

6. What Are Digital Signatures and Digital Certificates?
    A digital signature ensures the authenticity and integrity of a message or document, while a digital certificate verifies the identity of the sender through a trusted authority.

    1. Digital Signature:A digital signature is like an electronic fingerprint.
        🔧 How It Works:
            Sender creates a hash of the message.
            Hash is encrypted using the sender’s private key.
            The encrypted hash is the digital signature.
            Receiver:
                Decrypts the signature using sender’s public key
                Hashes the received message
                Compares both hashes → if equal, message is valid and unmodified.

     2. Digital Certificate (SSL Certificate):
        A digital certificate is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) to link a public key to an organization or individual’s identity.
            --Confirms the owner of a public key
        
        🔧 What It Contains:
            Owner’s public key
            Owner’s identity details (domain, company)
            CA's digital signature
            Expiry date, serial number, and algorithm info

7. What Are Active and Passive Attacks in Information Security?
    1. Passive Attacks
        Goal: Eavesdrop or monitor data without altering it.
            Does not affect system operation
            Hard to detect, but can leak sensitive information
            eg. Packet sniffing(wireshark) , traffic analysis
    
    2. Active Attacks
        Goal: Disrupt, modify, or spoof data or system behavior.
            Changes or corrupts data
            Often causes damage or unauthorized access
        Examples:
            Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
            Denial of Service (DoS)
            Session hijacking

8.  What Are the Types of Email Attacks?
    📧 Common Types of Email Attacks:
        1. Phishing
            Attacker sends fake emails posing as trusted entities (like a bank, employer, etc.).
            Goal: Steal credentials, personal info, or make the victim click on malicious links.
        
        2. Email Spoofing
            The "From" address is forged to make the email look like it’s coming from someone you trust.
            Often used in phishing or spam campaigns.
        
        3. Malware Attachments
            Email contains infected attachments (PDF, Word, ZIP, etc.).
            Once opened, malware like ransomware, spyware, or trojans infect the system.
    
9.  What is Cryptography?
    Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming it into a secure format, so that only intended recipients can access and understand it.
    It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data.

    Principle	        Purpose
    Confidentiality	    Only authorized users can read the data
    Integrity	        Ensures the data hasn’t been altered
    Authentication	    Confirms the sender/receiver identity
    Non-repudiation	    Prevents denial of having sent or received data

    1. Symmetric Key Cryptography
        Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt.
        Fast, but key sharing must be secure.
        Example: AES, DES
    
    2. Asymmetric Key Cryptography
        Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.
        Solves key distribution problem.
        Example: RSA, ECC
    
    3. Hash Functions (One-way)
        Converts data into a fixed-size hash (digest).
        Cannot be reversed. Used for integrity checks.
        Example: SHA-256, 

10. What is Cryptanalysis?
    Cryptanalysis is the process of analyzing and breaking cryptographic algorithms or ciphers to extract secrets. It's crucial in testing and improving the security strength of encryption systems.
