1. What is Firewall?
    A firewall is a security system—either hardware, software, or both—that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
    Traffic Filtering:
        --It examines packets based on IP address, port, or protocol.
        --Blocks or allows traffic depending on rules set by the network admin.

2. Types of firewall.
    Firewalls are security systems that control incoming and outgoing network traffic, and they come in various types based on how deep they inspect the data.

    A Packet-Filtering Firewall works at the Network Layer (Layer 3) and checks packet headers—like source/destination IP, port, and      protocol—for basic filtering, often used in routers.

        A Stateful Inspection Firewall adds more security by keeping track of active connections and only allowing packets that match an existing session, working at both Layer 3 and 4.

    A Proxy Firewall, also known as an Application-Level Gateway, acts as an intermediary for specific applications like web or email, inspecting traffic at a deeper level for content filtering.

        A Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) combines traditional firewall features with deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, and malware detection, working up to Layer 7, and is ideal for complex enterprise environments. 

    Lastly, a NAT Firewall hides internal private IP addresses by allowing only outbound-initiated traffic, providing basic security for home or office networks using private IPs.


3.  What Are the Possible Attacks on Firewalls?
     Common Attacks on Firewalls:
        IP Spoofing : involves faking a trusted IP to bypass rules
            
        Port Scanning :  probes for open ports to find weak spots.

        Packet Fragmentation Attack : Attackers may use packet fragmentation to split malicious payloads and sneak past detection
           
        Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) : they launch DoS/DDoS attacks to flood and overwhelm the firewall
        
        Tunneling Attacks :  Malicious data is hidden inside allowed protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS)

        Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) : Without enforcing encryption, firewalls are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, 
 
        Backdoor or Trojan Access :  backdoors or trojans inside the network can create outbound traffic to avoid inbound filters. 
        
        To defend against these, organizations should enable stateful inspection, use IDS/IPS systems, block unused ports, regularly audit rules, monitor traffic, and deploy Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) with deep packet inspection and advanced threat protection.

4. What Are Basic Network Attacks?
    Basic network attacks are attempts to disrupt services, steal data, or gain unauthorized access over a network
    A common example is a Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack, which floods a network or server with excessive traffic to make it unavailable—DDoS uses multiple machines to amplify the attack

    In a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, the attacker secretly intercepts communication between two parties,often on insecure Wi-Fi.

    IP spoofing and MAC spoofing involve faking IP or MAC addresses to bypass filters or impersonate trusted devices

    Brute force attacks try multiple username-password combinations to break into accounts, while phishing tricks users through fake messages or emails into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.

    These attacks highlight the importance of strong encryption, secure access controls, and user awareness in defending networks.

    Tools like Wireshark are used in packet sniffing to capture and read unencrypted data passing through a network


5.  What is Denial of Service (DoS) and How Can It Be Prevented?
    A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to make a system, server, or network unavailable due to excessive  flood of traffic or requests. When the attack comes from multiple distributed sources, it’s called a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). These attacks can use techniques like SYN floods or HTTP request floods to overload the target, causing slowdowns, crashes, or total unavailability for legitimate users.

    To prevent or mitigate these attacks, organizations use methods like rate limiting (limiting requests per user/IP), firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block unusual traffic patterns
    We can also use anti-DDoS services like Cloudflare or AWS Shield that filter out attack traffic. Using CDNs and  load balancers helps to distribute load across servers. Additionally, blackhole routing can redirect harmful traffic to a dead end to protect real resources.

6. What Are Digital Signatures and Digital Certificates?
    1. Digital Signature:A digital signature is like an electronic fingerprint.
        🔧 How It Works:
            The sender creates a hash of the message and encrypts it using their private key—this becomes the digital signature. The receiver decrypts it using the sender’s public key, hashes the received message, and if both hashes match, it confirms the message is genuine and unmodified

    2. A digital certificate (like an SSL certificate) is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) to verify the identity of the certificate holder
         it includes the owner’s details, the public key, the CA’s signature, expiration date, and other info
    
     A digital signature validates the content, a digital certificate validates the sender’s identity through a trusted authority.
        
7. What Are Active and Passive Attacks in Information Security?
    Passive attacks are focused on silently monitoring or eavesdropping on data without changing it. They don’t interfere with system operations, making them difficult to detect, but they can still expose sensitive information. Common examples include packet sniffing using tools like Wireshark and traffic analysis.
    
    In contrast, active attacks aim to disrupt, modify, or spoof data or system behavior. These attacks are more damaging, often resulting in data corruption, unauthorized access, or service disruption. Examples include Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), and session hijacking.
     While passive attacks are about stealing information quietly, active attacks directly interfere with the system.

8.  What Are the Types of Email Attacks?
    Email attacks are a common way for attackers to trick users and compromise systems.
    One major type is phishing, where attackers send fake emails pretending to be from trusted sources—like a bank or employer—to steal passwords, personal details, or get users to click on malicious links.
    Another is email spoofing, where the attacker forges the "From" address to make the message look like it’s from someone the recipient knows, often used to support phishing or spam.
    A third common method is sending malware attachments—like infected PDFs, Word documents, or ZIP files—which, once opened, can install ransomware, spyware, or trojans on the victim's computer. These attacks highlight the importance of email filtering, antivirus software, and user awareness.
    
9.  What is Cryptography?
    Cryptography is the science of securing information by converting it into a form that is unreadable to unauthorized users
    It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data.

    Principle	        Purpose
    Confidentiality	    Only authorized users can read the data
    Integrity	        Ensures the data hasn’t been altered
    Authentication	    Confirms the sender/receiver identity
    Non-repudiation	    Prevents denial of having sent or received data

    Cryptography mainly includes symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing methods.
    In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it fast and efficient, but the key must be securely shared. Examples include AES and DES.
    In asymmetric key cryptography, two keys are used—a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. This solves the key distribution problem and is used in secure communications like RSA and ECC.
    Hash functions, on the other hand, are one-way algorithms that convert data into a fixed-size hash or digest, which cannot be reversed. They are mainly used to verify data integrity, with common examples being SHA-256 or MD5.

10. What is Cryptanalysis?
    Cryptanalysis is the process of studying and breaking encryption systems to uncover hidden information without knowing the key. 
    It involves finding weaknesses or patterns in cryptographic algorithms or ciphers that can be exploited to decrypt data or retrieve keys.

11.  AES, DES, RSA, and MD5 — What Are They & How Do They Differ?
    There are several widely used cryptographic algorithms, each serving a different purpose.
    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a fast and secure symmetric key algorithm that uses 128, 192, or 256-bit keys with a 128-bit block size, commonly used in Wi-Fi, SSL, and VPNs.
    DES (Data Encryption Standard) is also symmetric but uses only a 56-bit key, making it insecure by today’s standards and now largely replaced by AES.
    On the asymmetric side, RSA is used for encrypting small amounts of data, digital signatures, and secure key exchange, with key sizes like 1024 or 2048 bits.
    Lastly, MD5 is a hash function that produces a 128-bit digest and is used for checksums and basic integrity checks, but it’s considered broken and unsuitable for secure applications today due to known vulnerabilities.

12. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?
    A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is a cyberattack where an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other.
