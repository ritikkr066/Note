1. Client, Server, Peer, and Host – What Are They in Networking?
    1. Client
        A client is a device or program that requests services or data from another device (the server).
        It initiates communication.
        ✅ Example: Your browser (client) requests a web page from a web server.

        🗄️ 2. Server
            A server is a device or program that provides services or resources to clients.
            It waits for requests and responds to them.
            ✅ Example: A web server delivers websites, a database server serves queries.

        🤝 3. Peer
            A peer is both a client and a server in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.
            Peers share resources directly without a central server.
            ✅ Example: File sharing using BitTorrent — your system downloads and uploads files simultaneously.

        💻 4. Host
            A host is any device (computer, phone, etc.) connected to a network and capable of sending/receiving data.
            Both clients and servers are types of hosts.
            ✅ Example: Your laptop on Wi-Fi is a host, whether it runs a server or just browses the web.

2.  What Are Bandwidth, Jitter, Packet, and Frame in Networking?
    📶 1. Bandwidth
        Definition: The maximum rate at which data can be transferred over a network.
        Measured in: Mbps, Gbps (bits per second)
        Think of it like the width of a highway—wider means more data can flow at once.
        ✅ Example: A 100 Mbps connection can transfer 100 megabits of data per second.

    🔁 2. Jitter
        Definition: The variation in delay of received packets over a network.
        Low jitter = smoother streaming/voice calls. High jitter = glitches or lag.
        Caused by network congestion, route changes, etc.
        ✅ Example: In a video call, if packets arrive out of order or at uneven intervals, the video may freeze or stutter.

    📦 3. Packet
        Definition: A small chunk of data sent over a network.
        Packets include:
        Payload (the actual data)
        Header (info like source, destination, sequence number)
        ✅ Example: A 5 MB file is split into thousands of packets before being sent, and reassembled on arrival.

    📁 4. Frame
        Definition: A data unit at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2 in OSI model).
        Encapsulates a packet with extra information (like MAC addresses and error checking).
        Transmitted between two directly connected devices (like switches).
        ✅ Example: Ethernet frames carry IP packets within a local area network (LAN).
    
3.  Localhost, Bit Rate, Noise, Attenuation, and Distortion (in Networking)?
    🖥️ 1. Localhost
        Definition: A loopback network address that refers to the local machine.
        Usually resolved as IP address 127.0.0.1.
        Used for testing servers/applications without leaving your own device.
        ✅ Example: Running a web server locally → http://localhost:3000

    🔢 2. Bit Rate
        Definition: The number of bits transmitted per second over a communication channel.
        Measured in bps (bits per second), kbps, Mbps, Gbps.
        Higher bit rate = more data sent in less time.
        ✅ Example: A video stream at 5 Mbps bit rate needs a 5 Mbps or higher connection to stream smoothly.

    📢 3. Noise
        Definition: Unwanted electrical or signal interference that corrupts the transmitted data.
        Causes errors in transmission.
        Sources: electromagnetic interference (EMI), hardware faults, environment.
        ✅ Example: Crackling on a phone line or corrupted bits in a file transfer.

    📉 4. Attenuation
        Definition: The loss of signal strength over distance or medium.
        Increases with long cables, poor quality medium, or obstacles.
        Fixed using repeaters or amplifiers.
        ✅ Example: Wi-Fi signal weakening as you move farther from the router.

    🔄 5. Distortion
        Definition: Change in the shape or quality of a signal due to delay or interference in different parts of the signal.
        Occurs when signal components arrive at different times or are altered during transmission.
        ✅ Example: In audio, distorted sound means the original signal has been altered during transmission.


-----------------  Common Networking Commands: ----------------

1. ping
    Purpose: Checks connectivity between your system and a remote host.
    How it works: Sends ICMP echo requests and waits for a reply.
    Usage: ping google.com

2. netstat
    Purpose: Displays network connections, routing tables, and open ports.
    Helps you see which applications are using which ports.
    Usage:  netstat -an

3. tracert (Windows) / traceroute (Linux)
    Purpose: Shows the route (hops) a packet takes to reach a destination.
    Useful to find delays or broken links in a network path.
    Usage: tracert google.com

4. ipconfig (Windows)
    Purpose: Displays IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and more.
    Also used to renew or release DHCP IP addresses.
    Usage: ipconfig

5. nslookup
    Purpose: Queries DNS records to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
    Helps verify DNS configuration and issues.
    Usage: nslookup google.com

6.  route
    Purpose: Displays or modifies the IP routing table.
    Shows how data is routed to different networks.
    Usage:  route print       # View routing table
            route add ...     # Add a static route

7. pathping (Windows only)
    Purpose: Combines ping + tracert — shows route + packet loss and latency per hop.
    Takes more time but gives detailed diagnostics.
    Usage: pathping google.com

8. hostname
    Purpose: Displays the computer’s network name.

9. arp (Address Resolution Protocol)
    Purpose: Shows and manages the ARP cache — maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
    Usage:
        arp -a         # View ARP table
        arp -d <IP>    # Delete ARP entry
