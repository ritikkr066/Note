                                Error Detection and Correction
Q1.Explain Error Detection and error Correction?

    Error detection and correction  in computer networks ensure data integrity during transmission. Error detection identifies whether data has been corrupted during transit, using techniques like Parity Check (adds a parity bit for simple single-bit error detection), Checksum (adds a total sum for integrity verification), and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) which is used in detecting errors in larger data blocks using polynomial math.
     Error correction, on the other hand, not only detects but also fixes errors without needing retransmission. Common methods include Hamming Code (adds redundant bits to correct single-bit errors), Forward Error Correction (FEC) which adds extra bits to allow recovery without needing retransmission, and Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ), where the receiver detects an error and asks the sender to resend the data. For example, while TCP uses ARQ to retransmit lost packets, YouTube uses FEC to recover video data without buffering.

    Ans: Error detection and correction are essential concepts in computer networks to ensure reliable data transmission

    Error Detection
    Definition: The process of identifying errors that occur during data transmission. Errors can occur due to noise, interference, or data corruption in the communication channel.

    Techniques for Error Detection
    1.Parity Check:
        -> Adds a single parity bit to the data, making the total number of 1s either even (even parity) or odd (odd parity).
        -> Simple but can detect only single-bit errors.

    2.Checksum:
        -> A checksum is calculated by summing up all data bytes, then transmitting the sum alongside the data.
        -> The receiver recalculates the checksum to verify integrity.
    
    3.Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):
        -> A more robust technique using polynomial division to detect errors in large data blocks.

    Error Correction
    Definition: The process of identifying and fixing the detected errors without retransmitting the data.

    Techniques for Error Correction
    1.Hamming Code:
        -> Adds redundant bits to data to not only detect but also correct single-bit errors.
            Example: If 1010 is transmitted, redundant bits are added, making it 1010110.

    2.Forward Error Correction (FEC):
        -> The sender adds redundant data (extra bits) to enable the receiver to detect and correct errors on its own.
    
    3.Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ):
        -> Combines error detection with retransmission. If an error is detected, the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the corrupted data.

    Real-Life Example
    Scenario: Sending an email with an attachment.

    When you send an email, the attachment (data) is divided into packets and transmitted over the network.

    Error Detection: Each packet includes a checksum or CRC value. If the receiver detects a mismatch between the transmitted checksum and the calculated checksum, it knows the packet is corrupted.

    Error Correction: Depending on the protocol:
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Uses ARQ to request retransmission of the corrupted packet.
    FEC: In streaming video (e.g., YouTube), redundant data is added to correct errors without needing retransmission, ensuring smooth playback even on poor networks.
        How it Works:-
        Redundant Data Addition:
        -> Before sending the video packets, the sender applies a mathematical algorithm (e.g., Reed-Solomon code) to encode redundant information into the stream. This ensures that even if some packets are lost or corrupted during transmission, the original data can still be reconstructed.


                                        ROUTING ALGORITHM

Q2. Explain Routing algorithm in computer network?
    Ans:- Routing algorithms determine the path that  data packets take to travel from the source to the destination in a network

    Types of Routing Algorithms:-

    Static Routing:
        Definition: Routes are manually configured and do not change unless manually updated by the network administrator.
        Example: A small office network where all devices use predefined routes to communicate.

    Dynamic Routing:
        Definition: Routes are automatically updated based on network changes, such as congestion, link failures, or topology updates.
        Example Protocols: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), RIP (Routing Information Protocol), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

    Routing Protocols: OSPF, RIP, and BGP
    1. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a dynamic, link-state routing protocol widely used in enterprise networks for its scalability, speed, and reliability. It uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest path to each destination, ensuring efficient routing. OSPF organizes large networks into areas, with a backbone area (Area 0), to minimize routing table size and LSA flooding. Unlike protocols that send updates periodically, OSPF sends routing updates only when there are topology changes, making it bandwidth-efficient. It also supports CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) for flexible IP address allocation. Due to its fast convergence and support for large, hierarchical networks, OSPF is commonly used in corporate and data center environments where high availability and performance are essential.

        Example:
        Scenario:Company X has offices in three cities (New York, Chicago, San Francisco) connected by routers.
                Each router exchanges link-state advertisements (LSAs) with its neighbors.
                LSAs build a complete topology map, ensuring packets from New York reach San Francisco using the shortest path.
        
        Challenges in Small Networks/useful for large network:
            -> Resource Usage: OSPF consumes more CPU, memory, and bandwidth compared to RIP, which may be unnecessary for small networks with limited resources.
            -> hop count are unlimited.
            -> OSPF can handle large, complex networks due to its support for hierarchical areas.
            -> Changes are propagated only when necessary, reducing bandwidth usage in large networks.
            -> complex Configuration.
        
    2. RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is a dynamic, distance-vector routing protocol that determines the best path to a destination based on the number of hops—with a maximum limit of 15 hops, beyond which a route is considered unreachable. It is simple to configure and suitable for small networks, but not ideal for large or complex environments due to its slow convergence and periodic 30-second updates that can consume bandwidth. RIP is also prone to the count-to-infinity problem, although techniques like split-horizon and hold-down timers help reduce this issue. In real-world scenarios, RIP is often used in small office or branch networks, where ease of setup is more important than routing efficiency or scalability.
        Example:
            Scenario:A small office with three routers (R1, R2, R3):
                    R1: Knows the distance to R2 (1 hop).
                    R2: Knows the distance to R3 (1 hop).
                    RIP updates ensure R1 learns about R3 (2 hops via R2).
                    If R2 fails, R1 updates its table and removes the route to R3.

        ## Challenges in Large Networks:
            -> The hop count limit of 15 restricts scalability.Small networks generally have fewer routers, so the 15-hop limit is  sufficient.
            -> Periodic updates increase bandwidth usage as the number of routers grows.

    3. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a dynamic, path-vector routing protocol that plays a critical role in routing data across the Internet, especially between Autonomous Systems (AS) — which are large networks managed by a single organization or ISP. Unlike protocols that choose the shortest path by metrics like hops, BGP makes routing decisions based on paths, policies, and administrator-defined rules. It comes in two forms: iBGP (Interior BGP), used within the same AS, and eBGP (Exterior BGP), used between different ASes. BGP is highly scalable, capable of handling huge routing tables and allowing fine-grained policy control, which is essential for managing Internet traffic flow and peering agreements. Due to its flexibility and robustness, BGP is the backbone routing protocol of the global Internet infrastructure.

    Classification of Routing Algorithms:-

       1.Distance Vector Routing is a routing method where each router periodically shares its entire routing table with its direct neighbors. The table contains information about various destinations and the number of hops (distance) needed to reach them. Each router updates its table based on the information received, aiming to find the shortest path to every network. A classic example is RIP (Routing Information Protocol), which uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the best path based on hop count. While simple and easy to configure, distance vector protocols can be slower to converge and are vulnerable to issues like the count-to-infinity problem, especially in larger or more dynamic networks.

            Real-Life Example:
                A small network with routers A, B, and C:
                    -> A knows the distance to B (1 hop).
                    -> B shares its knowledge of C (2 hops) with A.
                    -> A updates its table: Distance to C = 3 hops (via B).
        
        2.Link State Routing is a dynamic routing approach where each router builds a complete map of the entire network topology, including all routers and the state and cost of their links. Instead of relying on neighbor updates, each router independently calculates the shortest path to every destination using algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm. This results in faster convergence and more accurate routing decisions, especially in large or complex networks. A prime example is OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), which sends Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) to all routers in the area, allowing them to maintain identical link-state databases and make informed routing choices. Link state protocols are more scalable and reliable than distance vector protocols but require more processing power and memory.

            Real-Life Example:
            In a company’s internal network, OSPF ensures packets take the fastest route by dynamically updating routes when a link fails or becomes congested.
        
        3. Path Vector Routing is a method where routers keep track of the entire path to reach a destination, not just the distance or cost. Each route includes a list of all the networks (or autonomous systems) the data must pass through. This helps routers easily detect and avoid routing loops—if a router sees its own name in the path, it knows there’s a loop and rejects it. A good example is BGP, which is used on the Internet to connect different networks. Unlike other methods, it only sends updates when changes happen, which saves bandwidth and keeps the network efficient


                                                IP ADDRESS & SUBNETTING

Q3. Example IP addressing and Subnetting?

        IP addressing:
            IP Address: A unique identifier for devices on a network
            IPv4: 32-bit address, written as four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
            IPv6: 128-bit address, written in hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).

            IPv4 Address Classes:-
            Class	Range (First Octet)         	Default Subnet Mask                    Usage

            A	    1 - 126                 	255.0.0.0 (8 bits network)	        Large organizations
            B	    128 - 191	                255.255.0.0 (16 bits network)	    Medium-sized organizations
            C	    192 - 223	                255.255.255.0 (24 bits network)	    Small networks
            D	    224 - 239	                Not applicable	                    Multicasting
            E	    240 - 255	                Not applicable	                    Reserved for experimental use

        Subnetting:
            Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network (such as 192.168.1.0/24) into smaller to enhance security, and reduce broadcast traffic.
            or,
            Subnetting divides a larger network into smaller, manageable subnetworks. It optimizes IP usage, improves security, and reduces broadcast traffic.

            Key Terms in Subnetting
                Subnet Mask: Defines the network and host portions of an IP address.
                    Example: 255.255.255.0 in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000.
                CIDR Notation: Compact representation of the subnet mask.
                    Example: /24 means the first 24 bits are network bits (255.255.255.0).
                Formula for Subnetting:
                    Number of Subnets: 2^n  (where n is the number of borrowed bits).
                    Number of Hosts per Subnet: 2^h-2 (where h is the number of host bits)
                                        (subtracting 2 for network and broadcast addresses)

            Subnetting Example
                Scenario:
                    You are given a network: 192.168.1.0/24.
                    You need to divide it into 4 subnets.
                Step-by-Step Process:
                    Determine Required Subnet Mask:
                    Original subnet mask: /24 (255.255.255.0).
                    To create 4 subnets, 
                    n=log2(4)=2 (borrow 2 bits).

                    New subnet mask: /26 (255.255.255.192).
                    
                    Calculate Subnet Ranges:
                        Subnet increment: 256-192=64 (last octet range).
                        Subnets:
                        Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63
                        Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.127
                        Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.191
                        Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192 - 192.168.1.255

                    Broadcast and Usable IPs:
                    Subnet 1:
                    Network Address: 192.168.1.0
                    Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.63
                    Usable IPs: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62
                    Similarly, calculate for other subnets.
        
        Real-Life Example:
             Use Case: Office Departments
                -> A company has a single network 192.168.1.0/24 and wants to divide it into subnets for four departments (HR, IT, Sales, and Marketing).
                -> By subnetting, each department gets its own subnet, ensuring security and efficient IP utilization.


                                                TCP & UDP                                       
    
Q4. Explain TCP and UDP?
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented and reliable transport layer protocol that ensures data is delivered accurately and in order between devices over a network. Before sending data, TCP establishes a connection using a handshake process, making sure both sender and receiver are ready. It uses acknowledgments (ACKs) and retransmission to ensure no data is lost or corrupted, and it maintains the correct sequence so that packets arrive exactly as they were sent. This makes TCP ideal for applications where reliability matters, such as web browsing, emails, and file transfers.
            or,
        Connection-Oriented: Establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data transfer.
        Reliable: Ensures data is delivered correctly by retransmitting lost packets.
        Ordered Delivery: Ensures packets are received in the same order they were sent.
        Error Checking: Uses acknowledgment (ACK) and retransmission mechanisms for error detection and correction.

        Use Cases:Applications where data integrity and order are critical.
            Example: Web Browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), File Transfer (FTP), Email (SMTP, IMAP).

        Real-Life Example:
            File Download: When downloading a file, TCP ensures every part of the file is received accurately and in sequence. If a part of the file is missing, it requests retransmission.

    UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
        UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless and lightweight transport protocol that sends data without establishing a connection, making it much faster and lower in latency compared to TCP. It doesn’t guarantee delivery, order, or error correction, and there are no acknowledgments or retransmissions, which reduces overhead. Because of this, UDP is ideal for real-time applications like video streaming, online gaming, VoIP, or DNS lookups, where speed is more important than perfect reliability. It's efficient but best used in situations where occasional data loss is acceptable.
                or,
        Connectionless: No need to establish a connection before sending data.
        Unreliable: No guarantee of packet delivery, order, or error correction.
        Low Latency: Faster than TCP due to minimal overhead.
        No Acknowledgments: Suitable for real-time applications.

        Use Cases:Applications where speed is critical, and occasional data loss is acceptable.
            Example: Video Streaming, Online Gaming, VoIP, DNS Queries.
        
        Real-Life Example:
            Video Streaming: In YouTube or Netflix streaming, UDP transmits data quickly. Minor packet losses won't significantly affect video playback since retransmissions could cause delays.

    Example of TCP and UDP in Action
        TCP:
        Scenario: Sending an email using SMTP.
        Steps:
            -> TCP establishes a connection between your email client and the mail server.
            -> Data (email content) is divided into packets and sent.
            -> The server sends acknowledgments for received packets.
            -> Missing packets are retransmitted.
            -> Connection is closed after successful transmission.
        Benefit: Ensures the email is delivered completely and correctly.

        UDP:
        Scenario: Playing an online multiplayer game.
        Steps:
            -> Game data (e.g., player movements) is transmitted using UDP.
            -> Packets are sent without waiting for acknowledgments.
            -> Minor packet losses are ignored, maintaining real-time performance.
        Benefit: Fast updates without delays, even if some data is lost.

        Notes:-
        -> Use TCP when reliability and data integrity are critical, such as in web browsing or file transfers.
        -> UDP does not establish a connection, track packets, or handle retransmissions, making it faster but less reliable.

    Three-way handshake in TCP?
        A process to establish a connection:
            SYN: Client sends a connection request to the server.
            SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges and responds with its request.
            ACK: Client acknowledges the server's response, and the connection is established.
    
    The four-way handshake in TCP is used to gracefully terminate a connection. First, the sender sends a FIN (Finish) packet to indicate it has finished sending data. The receiver responds with an ACK to acknowledge the FIN. Once the receiver is also ready to close the connection, it sends its own FIN packet. Finally, the original sender replies with an ACK, confirming the termination. This orderly process ensures that both sides finish communication cleanly.


                                    Flow Control and Congestion Control


Q5. Explain Flow control and congestion control?

    Flow Control(Focus:Receiver's capacity)
        Flow control is a technique used in networking to make sure the sender doesn’t send data too fast for the receiver to handle. If the sender sends too much data too quickly, the receiver’s buffer might overflow, causing data loss. To avoid this, the receiver tells the sender how much data it can handle, and the sender adjusts its speed based on this feedback. This helps maintain smooth communication and prevents overload, especially in protocols like TCP.
        
        Mechanisms:
        1. In the Stop-and-Wait method, the sender sends one data packet at a time and then waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the next packet. This ensures that the receiver has successfully received and processed each packet before the next one is sent. It’s a simple and reliable way to control the flow, but can be slow, especially over long-distance or high-speed networks, because the sender stays idle while waiting for the ACK.
        
       2. The Sliding Window Protocol is a smarter flow control method where the sender can send multiple packets at once without waiting for an acknowledgment after each one. The number of packets that can be sent before needing an ACK is called the window size. As the receiver sends back acknowledgments, the window "slides forward," allowing the sender to send more packets. This improves efficiency and speed, especially over fast or long-distance networks, while still making sure the receiver isn’t overwhelmed.
    
    Congestion Control(Focus:Network's capacity )
        Congestion control is a method used to prevent too much data from crowding the network, which can cause delays and packet loss. It focuses on the network’s capacity, not just the receiver

        The sender watches for signs of congestion, like lost packets or delays, and then slows down or adjusts its sending speed to reduce the load. This helps keep the network running smoothly. TCP has built-in congestion control to handle this automatically during data transmission.
        
        How It Works:
            -> The sender monitors the network conditions and adjusts its transmission rate to avoid congestion.
            -> Commonly implemented in TCP.
        
        Real-Life Example:
            -> Streaming Services (e.g., YouTube): If the network becomes congested, video quality is dynamically reduced to maintain playback without buffering.

    Sequence Number and Acknowledgment in TCP
        Sequence numbers and acknowledgments are essential for reliable data transfer

        Sequence Number:
            -> A sequence number is a unique identifier assigned to each byte of data in a TCP connection.
            -> Helps in detecting missing or duplicate packets.
    
        Acknowledgment Number:
            -> The acknowledgment number indicates the next sequence number the receiver expects to receive.
            -> It informs the sender that all data up to a certain byte has been successfully received

    Syn Flooding Attack
        -> A SYN flood attack is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that exploits the TCP three-way handshake process. The attacker overwhelms the server by sending a large number of TCP SYN (synchronize) requests without completing the handshake, consuming the server's resources and rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.


                                        Networking Devices

Q6. Explain Networking Devices?

    1. Hub
        -> A Hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a network and allows data to be transmitted between them.
        -> Operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.
        -> Broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices.
        ->Causes network collisions in large networks.
        Example:
            A small office network where all computers are connected via a hub. If one computer sends data, the hub forwards it to all other computers.

    2. Switch
        -> A Switch is a more advanced device that connects multiple devices in a network and forwards data to the specific device based on its MAC address.
        -> Operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and sometimes the Network Layer (Layer 3).
        -> Intelligent device—learns and stores the MAC addresses of connected devices.
        -> Reduces collisions by sending data only to the intended recipient.
        Example:
            In an office, a switch connects computers, printers, and servers, ensuring efficient communication between devices without broadcasting to all.

    3. Router
        -> A Router is a device that connects different networks and routes data packets between them.
        -> Operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3).
        -> Uses IP addresses to determine the best path for data.
        -> Provides features like NAT (Network Address Translation), firewall protection, and DHCP.
        -> Used in both LANs (Local Area Networks) and WANs (Wide Area Networks).
        Example:
            A home router connects your local network (e.g., computers, smart devices) to the internet and manages traffic.

        Network Address Translation (NAT)
            -> Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process where a network device (typically a router or firewall) translates private IP addresses used in a local network into a single public IP address  before forwarding data to the internet. It operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.

            -> Allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.
            -> Hides internal private IP addresses from external networks, reducing the risk of direct attacks.
    
    4. Gateway
        -> A Gateway acts as a translator between two different networks or systems using different protocols.
        -> Operates at all layers of the OSI model, depending on the functionality.
        -> Converts data formats and protocols for compatibility.
        Example:
            A VoIP gateway converts voice signals into IP packets for transmission over the internet.

    5. Bridge
        -> A Bridge connects two or more network segments and reduces traffic by filtering data based on MAC addresses.
        -> Operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
        -> Helps divide a large network into smaller, more manageable segments.
        Example:
            A bridge connects two separate LANs in a building, ensuring efficient communication without broadcasting to the entire network.
    
    6. Firewall
        -> A Firewall is a device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
        -> Operates at multiple layers of the OSI model, primarily at Layer 3 (Network) and Layer 4 (Transport).
        -> Protects networks from unauthorized access and cyberattacks
        Example:
            A company uses a hardware firewall to block malicious traffic and prevent unauthorized access to its internal network.

    7. Access Point (AP)
        -> An Access Point allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi or other standards.
        -> Operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
        -> Extends the range of a wired network.
        -> Does not route data—requires a router for internet access.
        Example:
            In a coffee shop, the wireless access point enables customers to connect to the internet using their laptops or smartphones.

    8. Modem (Modulator-Demodulator)
        -> A Modem is a device that modulates and demodulates signals for transmitting data over telephone lines, fiber optics, or satellite links.
            Modulation:- converting digital signals into analog signals
            Demodulation:- converting received analog signals back into digital signals

        -> Used to connect to the internet via ISPs (Internet Service Providers).
        -> A DSL modem connects a home computer to the internet using a telephone line.

    9. Repeater
        -> A Repeater is a network device that regenerates and amplifies signals to extend the distance they can travel without degradation.
        -> Operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.
        -> Does not interpret the data; simply regenerates the signal.
        -> Helps overcome attenuation (loss of signal strength over long distances).
        Example:
            In wireless networks, repeaters can be used to extend the range of Wi-Fi signals in large homes or offices.

                                        OSI model and TCP/IP model

Q7. Explain OSI model?

    The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework/(reference model) used to understand and standardize the functions of a network protocol. It divides the process of network communication into seven distinct layers, each responsible for specific tasks. Here's a simple breakdown of each layer and its key functions:

    1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)
    - Role: Handles the physical connection between devices. 
    - Function: Defines hardware elements like cables, switches, and the electrical signals used for data transmission.
    - Example: The Ethernet cables and the physical ports on your router.

    2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
    - Role: Manages communication between devices on the same network.
    - Function: Responsible for error detection, frame synchronization, and controlling how data is placed onto the network.
    - Example: Ethernet frames and MAC addresses used to identify devices on the same network.

    3. Network Layer (Layer 3)
    - Role: Determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
    - Function: Handles routing of data packets and logical addressing (IP addresses) to ensure they reach the correct destination.
    - Example: IP addresses and routers that direct data from one network to another.

    4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)
    - end to end delivery of data 
    - Role: Ensures reliable data transfer between devices.
    - Function: Manages data flow control, error correction, and retransmission of lost data. It breaks data into segments and ensures they are reassembled correctly.
    - Example: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

    5. Session Layer (Layer 5)
    - Role: Manages sessions or connections between applications.
    - Function: Controls the start, maintenance, and termination of sessions between applications, enabling communication and data exchange.
    it  actually define the  timeframe b/w   client and server. for eg : if we login into secure website, if we can't to anything for sometime , we can logout automatically. 
    - Example: Session management in online chat applications.

    6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
    - Role: Translates data between the application layer and the network.
    - Function: Handles data encoding, encryption, and compression to ensure that data is in a readable format for the application layer.
    - Example: Encryption protocols like SSL/TLS and data formats like JPEG or GIF.
    - it can the check the format of data , like if it image then formats will be jpeg , gif etc.

    7. Application Layer (Layer 7)
    - Role: Provides network services directly to end-user applications.
    - Function: Interfaces with software applications to provide network services such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.
    - Example: HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, and FTP for file transfer.

    Summary
    - Layer 1 (Physical): Deals with hardware and physical connections.
    - Layer 2 (Data Link): Manages data frames and device addressing.
    - Layer 3 (Network): Handles routing and logical addressing.
    - Layer 4 (Transport): Ensures reliable data transfer and flow control.
    - Layer 5 (Session): Manages sessions and connections between applications.
    - Layer 6 (Presentation): Translates, encrypts, and compresses data.
    - Layer 7 (Application): Provides network services to end-user applications.

    example:-
    Summary of the Example:
    - Physical Layer: Sends the raw data bits through the physical connection (cable or wireless).
    - Data Link Layer: Frames the data with MAC addresses for local network delivery.
    - Network Layer: Routes the data across networks using IP addresses.
    - Transport Layer: Ensures the data packets are sent reliably and in the correct order.
    - Session Layer: Manages the connection session between the email client and server.
    - Presentation Layer: Encodes and formats the email data for transmission.
    - Application Layer: Interfaces with the email client and server to send and receive emails.

Q8. Explain TCP/IP model?
    The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) Model is a more practical and simplified model for communication in real-world networks. It has 4 layers.

    Layers of the TCP/IP Model (Top to Bottom):
    1. Application Layer:
    - Combines the functions of OSI Layers 7, 6, and 5.
        Example: HTTP (web browsing), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email).

    2. Transport Layer:
    - Ensures reliable or unreliable delivery using TCP or UDP.
        Example: TCP for reliable streaming and UDP for live gaming.
    
    3. Internet Layer:
    - Maps to the OSI Network Layer and handles logical addressing and routing.
        Example: IP routes packets across networks.
    
    4. Network Interface Layer:
    - Combines OSI Layers 1 and 2 to handle hardware and local data transmission.
        Example: Ethernet or Wi-Fi managing local data exchange.

                                        Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer Models

Q9. Explain Client-Server model?
        In the client-server model, there is a central server that provides services, resources, or data, and multiple clients request these services
        Example Applications:
            -> Web servers (e.g., a browser requests a web page from a server).
            -> Email servers (e.g., sending or receiving emails using Gmail).
            -> Online banking (client apps request data from the bank's servers).
        
        Single point of failure: If the server is down, clients cannot access resources.

Q10. Explain Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model?
        In the peer-to-peer model, there is no central server. Each node (peer) acts as both a client and a server, sharing resources directly with other peers.
        Example Applications:
        -> Blockchain and cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin).
        -> File-sharing platforms (e.g., BitTorrent).

        -> Budget: Factor in costs for hardware, software, and ongoing maintenance.

                    NETWORK TOPOLOGY

Explain Network topology?

    Network Topologies
        The layout or structure of a network, describing how devices are connected.

    1.Bus Topology:- All devices are connected to a central cable, known as the bus or backbone. Signals are sent along this bus, and all devices receive them.
        disadvantages:-If the central bus fails, the entire network goes down.

    2.Star Topology:- All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Each device has a dedicated point-to-point connection to the hub.
        disadvantages:-If the central hub or switch fails, the entire network is affected.

    3.Ring Topology:-Each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a circular data path. Data travels in one direction (or both, in a dual ring topology).
        disadvantages:-A failure in any single connection or device can disrupt the entire network.

    4.Mesh Topology:-Devices are interconnected, with each device having multiple connections to other devices. This can be a full mesh (every device connects to every other device) or a partial mesh (some devices are connected, but not all).
        disadvantages:-Expensive due to the amount of cabling and hardware required.

    5.Tree Topology:-A combination of star and bus topologies. Groups of star-configured networks are connected to a linear bus backbone. It’s hierarchical, with a central node at the top and branches extending below.
        disadvantages:-If the backbone fails, the entire network can be affected.
                        More complex and expensive than star or bus topologies



                                        IMPORTANT QUESTION

# ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it uses ARP to find the corresponding MAC address for the given IP address
	ARP: For mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.
	ARP: Broadcasts requests and receives responses to map IP addresses to MAC addresses.


# ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):
	ICMP: For error reporting and network diagnostics.
	ICMP: Sends control and error messages encapsulated within IP packets.

Q. What are Unicasting, Anycasting, Multicasting and Broadcasting? 
    Unicasting, Anycasting, Multicasting, and Broadcasting are network communication methods that define how data is transmitted across a network to one or more recipients.

    1. Unicasting:
        -> Unicasting is a one-to-one communication method where data is sent from a single source to a single destination.
        Example:- Video Call: When you make a Zoom or Skype call to a specific person, the data packets are sent directly from your device to the recipient's device.

        Protocol Example: TCP/IP, HTTP.
        Use Case: Video streaming, file downloads, secure communication.
    
    2. Anycasting:
        -> Anycasting is a one-to-nearest communication method where data is sent from a single source to the closest or most optimal destination among a group of potential receivers.
        Example: A DNS query is resolved by the nearest DNS server using Anycasting.
                -> CDNs (Content Delivery Networks): When you stream a video from Netflix or access a web page, the content is delivered from the nearest CDN server, ensuring faster load times and reduced latency.

        Protocol Example: IPv6 supports Anycasting natively.
        Use Case: Load balancing, fast content delivery.

    3. Multicasting:
        -> Multicasting is a one-to-many communication method where data is sent from a single source to multiple destinations, but only to those devices that have explicitly opted to receive the data.
        Example: Live video streaming or webinars to a selected audience.
            ->Live Webinars: A company hosting a webinar sends the video feed only to users who have registered and joined the event.

        Protocol Example: IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) for IPv4, MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) for IPv6.
        Use Case: Video conferencing, live sports broadcasting.

    4. Broadcasting:
        -> Broadcasting is a one-to-all communication method where data is sent from a single source to all devices within a network segment.
        -> Inefficient for large networks, as all devices receive the data regardless of their interest.
        -> Protocol Example: Ethernet, ARP.
        -> Use Case: Device discovery, network booting (PXE).

        Example:
        Wi-Fi Network Discovery: When your phone searches for available Wi-Fi networks, it broadcasts a message asking all nearby routers to respond with their SSIDs (network names).

        Radio Broadcasting: A radio station sends its signal, and all radio receivers tuned to that frequency can receive the broadcast.

        ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): When a computer wants to find the MAC address of another device in the same network, it sends an ARP broadcast request, and the target device responds.

    

    Q. What happens when you enter google.com in the web browser?
    Ans When you enter google.com into a web browser, several steps occur in sequence to load the webpage
        1. DNS Resolution:The browser checks the local DNS cache for the IP address of google.com.
        2. TCP Connection (Three-Way Handshake): The browser establishes a TCP connection with Google's server using the resolved IP address on port 443 (HTTPS).
        3. SSL/TLS Handshake : The browser and server exchange cryptographic keys to encrypt the communication.
        4. HTTP Request : The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS GET request to fetch the webpage.
        5. Server Processing : The Google server processes the request, retrieves the necessary resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and sends an HTTP response.
        6. Rendering the Page: Display the page.

        Simplified Flow Summary
            -> DNS Resolution: google.com → IP address.
            -> TCP Connection: Establish connection.
            -> TLS Handshake: Secure the connection.
            -> HTTP Request/Response: Fetch the webpage.
            -> Rendering: Display the page.
