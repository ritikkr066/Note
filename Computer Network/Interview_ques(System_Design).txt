1. Difference between http:// and https://
    HTTP and HTTPS are both protocols for communication but they are different in several ways and the main difference is security.

    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the basic protocol used to transfer data over the web. It does not encrypt the data, so information is sent in plain text, which makes it vulnerable to interception by attackers.

    HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to encrypt the data being transferred between the client and server
         This ensures:
            Confidentiality: Data is encrypted.
            Integrity: Data cannot be modified during transmission.
            Authentication: Confirms the website is legitimate via SSL certificates.

2.  What is an API Gateway?
    An API Gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for all client requests to a set of backend services or microservices.
        Key Functions of an API Gateway:
            Request Routing: Forwards client requests to the appropriate backend service.
            Authentication & Authorization: Validates tokens (like JWT) before allowing access.
            Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic to multiple service instances.

3 What is SSL/TLS?
    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over a network—especially the internet.
    How it works (Brief):
        When you visit a website using https://, the browser initiates a TLS handshake.
        The server sends its SSL/TLS certificate.
        The client (browser) verifies it, and they agree on an encryption method.
        A secure encrypted channel is established for communication

4. What is a Reverse Proxy?
    A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of backend servers and forwards client requests to those servers. Unlike a forward proxy, which works on behalf of clients, a reverse proxy works on behalf of servers.
    Key Responsibilities of a Reverse Proxy:
        Load Balancing: Distributes client requests across multiple backend servers.
        Security: Hides internal server details and can filter malicious requests.
        Caching: Stores frequently requested responses to improve performance.
        Compression: Reduces the size of responses to improve speed.

5. What is a Load Balancer?
    A Load Balancer is a system (software or hardware) that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed and that the application remains highly available, reliable, and scalable.
    Key Functions of a Load Balancer:
    Traffic Distribution: Balances traffic among servers using algorithms like:Round Robin,Least Connections,IP Hash
    High Availability: Redirects traffic if a server goes down, ensuring uptime.
    SSL Termination: Can decrypt SSL/TLS traffic before passing it to backend servers.
    Scalability: Helps handle more users by spreading the load across servers.

6. What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?
    ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local area network (LAN).
    When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it knows the destination IP address but needs the corresponding MAC address to send the Ethernet frame. ARP is used to resolve this.

    How ARP Works (Briefly):
    The sender broadcasts an ARP request:
        "Who has IP 192.168.1.10? Tell me your MAC address."
    The device with that IP replies with an ARP response:
        "I have IP 192.168.1.10, and my MAC address is 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E."
    The sender stores this mapping in its ARP cache for future use

7. What is the difference between Horizontal and Vertical Scaling?
    Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling are two strategies used to improve a system's performance and handle increased load.
    1. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):
        Involves adding more machines or instances to your system
        You distribute the load across multiple servers.
            Adding more application servers behind a load balancer.
    
    2. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):
        Involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) of an existing machine.
        You make a single server more powerful.
            Upgrading from 8 GB RAM to 32 GB RAM on a server.

8. What is caching? how does a website is cached ?
    Caching is the process of storing copies of data in a temporary storage location so future requests for that data can be served faster without recomputing or refetching it from the original source.
     How a Website is Cached?
        User visits a site.
        Browser checks its cache: if a resource is fresh (based on headers), it uses the cached version.
        If not cached or expired, it requests the server/CDN.
        Server/CDN(Content Delivery Network) might serve cached content or regenerate and cache it for next time.

    Benefits of Caching:
        Faster load times
        Reduced server load
        Better user experience
        Cost-efficient for high-traffic websites

9. What is VIP (Virtual IP) in Computer Networks?
    A VIP (Virtual IP address) is an IP address that is not tied to a specific physical network interface (NIC). Instead, it is assigned to one or more devices or services virtually, and it can move between hosts as needed.
    How VIP Works:  
    A cluster of servers shares one VIP.
    Only one server actively uses the VIP at a time.
    If the active server fails, the VIP is quickly reassigned to a standby server.
    Clients continue to connect to the same IP, unaware of any changes in the backend.

10. REST API vs HTTP API?
    While both REST API and HTTP API use the HTTP protocol, they are not the same. A REST API is a type of HTTP API, but not all HTTP APIs are RESTful.
    1. HTTP API:
        Generic term for any API that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
        Commonly used for building lightweight or custom-designed web services.
    
    2. REST API (Representational State Transfer):
        A specific architectural style for designing networked applications.
        Built on top of HTTP with strict rules and principles.

        eg. GET /users – Fetch list of users
            POST /users – Create a new user
            PUT /users/1 – Update user with ID 1
            DELETE /users/1 – Delete user with ID 1

11. What is a Container in Computer Networks?
    In computer networking and software infrastructure, a container is a lightweight, portable, and isolated runtime environment that packages an application along with all its dependencies, libraries, and configurations.
    It ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, production) regardless of the underlying system.

12.  Containerization vs Virtualization?
    Containerization and Virtualization are two technologies used to run multiple isolated environments on a single physical machine — but they differ in how they achieve isolation and in performance, efficiency, and use case.

    1. Virtualization:
        Virtualization uses hypervisors (like VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V) to create Virtual Machines (VMs).
        Each VM includes a full guest OS, its own kernel, and apps.
    Example: Running Ubuntu and Windows side by side using a hypervisor.
        Hypervisors:
            A hypervisor is a software layer (also called a Virtual Machine Monitor - VMM) that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting and sharing the physical hardware of a host machine.
            It allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously and independently on the same physical hardware.

    2. Containerization:
        Containerization uses a shared host OS kernel and isolates apps in user-space containers.
        Containers are lightweight, fast to start, and have smaller footprints
        Popular tools: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes (for orchestration).

13.  Performance vs Scalability ?
    Performance:
    Refers to how fast a system responds to a given workload or task.
    Measures metrics like response time, throughput, latency, and resource usage.
    Example: How quickly a webpage loads or how many requests per second a server can handle right now.

    Scalability:
    Refers to the system’s ability to handle increasing workload by adding resources.
    Measures how well a system grows when more users, data, or transactions occur.
    Two types:
        Vertical Scaling: Adding more power to existing machines (CPU, RAM).
        Horizontal Scaling: Adding more machines or instances.
    Example: Can your web app handle 10x more users if you add more servers?

14.  Latency vs Throughput? 
    Latency and Throughput are two fundamental metrics used to measure network or system performance — but they refer to different things.
    🕒 1. Latency:
        Definition: The time delay between sending a request and receiving a response.
        Measured in milliseconds (ms).
        Think of it as "reaction time".
        Lower latency = faster response.
    eg. If you click a link and it takes 100ms for the server to respond, the latency is 100ms.

    2. Throughput:
        Definition: The amount of data transferred over a network (or processed by a system) in a given time.
        Measured in bits/sec, Mbps, requests/sec, etc.
        Think of it as "bandwidth" or "capacity".
        Example:
        A server handling 10,000 requests per second has high throughput.

15.  2G vs 3G vs 4G vs 5G?
    These are generations of mobile network technologies, each improving over the previous in terms of speed, latency, capacity, and capabilities.
    2G: First digital network – supported calls and SMS.
    3G: Introduced mobile internet, video calls, and faster downloads.
    4G: Made HD streaming, gaming, and fast browsing possible.
    5G: Enables real-time applications like autonomous cars, IoT, and smart cities with massive speed and ultra-low latency.

16. How does a VPN work?
    A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server operated by the VPN provider. It hides your IP address and encrypts all the data you send and receive, making your online activity private and secure.
    🔧 How It Works (Step-by-Step):
        Connection to VPN Server:
            You start a VPN client on your device and choose a VPN server (e.g., in another country).

        Encrypted Tunnel:
            The VPN client encrypts your internet traffic before sending it through the tunnel to the VPN server.

        Masking Your IP:
            The VPN server decrypts the traffic and forwards it to the internet using its own IP address, hiding your original one.

        Response:
            The response from the website or service goes back to the VPN server → gets encrypted → sent back to your device → decrypted by your client.
    
17.  Gateway vs Router?
    Both Gateway and Router are networking devices, but they serve different purposes in connecting and managing networks.
    📶 Router:
        A router connects multiple devices within the same network and forwards data between them and to the internet.
        It determines the best path for data packets.
        Used primarily for routing within similar networks (e.g., home or office LAN to the internet).
        Example:
        Your home Wi-Fi router connects your laptop, phone, and smart TV to the internet.
    
    Gateway:
        A gateway connects two different networks that use different protocols.
        It acts as a protocol translator and can work at any OSI layer depending on the type.
        Used to bridge dissimilar systems, e.g., enterprise network to external cloud.
        Example:
        A VoIP gateway converts voice calls from a traditional phone network (PSTN) to a digital IP-based network.

    Summary:
        A router directs traffic within or between similar networks.
        A gateway acts as a bridge between different networks or systems, often translating protocols.

18. NIC vs MAC Address?
    1. NIC (Network Interface Card):
        A hardware component that allows a device (computer, printer, etc.) to connect to a network.
        It can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).
        It operates on the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.
        Every NIC has a unique MAC address.
        Example:
        The LAN port on your laptop or the Wi-Fi chip is a NIC.
    
     2. MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):
        A unique identifier assigned to a NIC by the manufacturer.
        It’s a 12-digit hexadecimal number (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
        It helps in identifying the device on a local network (LAN).
        Used by switches to forward data to the correct device.
        Example:
        If you check your phone’s Wi-Fi settings, you’ll find its MAC address, linked to its NIC
    
    MAC address is the unique ID assigned to that hardware for device-level identification on a network.

19.  Public vs Private IP Address? 
    IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network. These are divided into public and private based on accessibility and usage scope.
     1. Public IP Address:
        Assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
        Globally unique and accessible over the Internet.
        Used to identify your network to the outside world.
        Usually assigned to routers or servers.
        Example:
        49.207.192.10 (can be seen from websites like whatismyip.com)
    2. Private IP Address:
        Used within local networks (like home or office).
        Not routable on the internet.
        Devices like laptops, phones, printers get private IPs from your router via DHCP.
       
    A public IP connects your network to the outside world, while a private IP keeps your internal devices connected within your local network.

20.  What is Multiplexing in Networking?
    Multiplexing is the process of combining multiple data signals into one for efficient transmission over a single medium — saving time, bandwidth, and cost.
    To send multiple streams of data simultaneously over a single communication channel without interference.

21. Modem vs Router?
    📡 1. Modem (Modulator-Demodulator):
        Connects your home/office network to the Internet via your ISP.
        Converts digital signals ↔ analog signals (over phone lines, cable, or fiber).
        Has one public IP address assigned by the ISP.
        Can only connect to one device directly (unless combined with a router).
    
    📶 2. Router:
        Distributes the internet from the modem to multiple devices (wired or wireless).
        Assigns private IP addresses to devices on the local network.
        Manages traffic, provides firewall, and enables Wi-Fi.
        Often includes NAT (Network Address Translation) to allow multiple devices to share one public IP.
        Example:
        Your Wi-Fi router at home that connects your phone, laptop, and smart TV.
    
    A modem brings the internet into your network from the ISP, while a router distributes it to multiple devices, often wirelessly.

22. How does Bluetooth work?
    Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communication technology used to connect devices over a secure, low-power radio frequency.
    How It Works:
        Bluetooth uses radio waves in the 2.4 GHz range to send data wirelessly.
        Devices first pair by sharing a code to create a secure connection.
        Once connected, they can communicate directly without internet or cables.
        It uses low power and short range (usually up to 10 meters).
        It can connect one device to many others in a small network (called a piconet).

23. How Does a Hotspot Work?
    A hotspot is a feature that allows a device (like a smartphone or router) to share its internet connection with other nearby devices using Wi-Fi.
    How It Works:
        A device (e.g. smartphone) connects to the internet using mobile data (4G/5G).
        It creates a Wi-Fi signal like a mini router.
        Other devices (laptop, tablet) connect to that Wi-Fi signal.
        The internet from the mobile data is shared with connected devices.
    
    A hotspot turns a device into a Wi-Fi access point, allowing it to share its internet connection  with other devices wirelessly.

24. How Does Email Work?
    Email is a way to send and receive messages electronically over the Internet using a set of protocols.
    🔧 How It Works (Simplified):
        Writing & Sending:
        You write an email using an email client (like Gmail or Outlook) and hit send.

        Sending Server (SMTP):
        Your email client sends the message to the SMTP server (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which handles outgoing mail.

        Routing:
        The SMTP server looks up the recipient’s email server using DNS (Domain Name System).

        Receiving Server (POP3/IMAP):
        The recipient’s email server receives and stores the message.
            POP3 downloads emails to the recipient’s device.
            IMAP syncs emails between the server and device.

        Reading:
        The recipient uses their email client to retrieve and read the message.

25.  How Does File Transfer Work?
    File transfer is the process of sending data files from one device to another over a network.
    🔧 How It Works (Simplified):
        Initiation:
        The sender selects the file to send and starts the transfer using a protocol or app (like FTP, HTTP, or peer-to-peer apps).

        Breaking into Packets:
        The file is split into small data packets to be sent over the network efficiently.

        Sending Packets:
        Packets travel from the sender to the receiver through routers and switches on the network.

        Receiving & Reassembling:
        The receiver collects all packets and reassembles them into the original file.

        Acknowledgment & Error Checking:
        The receiver sends acknowledgments to confirm receipt and requests retransmission if packets are lost or corrupted.

26.  How Does an ATM Work?
    An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) allows bank customers to perform financial transactions like cash withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries without visiting a bank branch.
    🔧 How It Works (Simplified):
        User Authentication:
        You insert your debit/credit card and enter your PIN to verify your identity.

        Transaction Request:
        You choose a transaction type (e.g., withdraw cash).

        Communication with Bank:
        The ATM sends your request and credentials to the bank’s central server via a secure network.

        Verification & Approval:
        The bank verifies your account balance and PIN, then sends back an approval or denial.

        Cash Dispensing / Service Execution:
        If approved, the ATM dispenses cash or completes the requested service.

        Transaction Logging:
        The transaction is recorded both in the ATM and the bank’s system for accountability.
    
27. How Do Packets Travel in a Network?
    Data sent over a network is broken into small units called packets, which travel from the source to the destination through various devices like routers and switches.
    🔧 How Packets Travel (Simplified Steps):
        Data is Broken into Packets:
        A large message (e.g. a file or webpage) is divided into smaller packets, each containing:
            Part of the data
            A header (source/destination IP, sequence number, etc.)

        Packets Enter the Network:
        The sender’s device sends packets to the local router or gateway.

        Routing Through the Internet:
            Routers use the destination IP address to decide where to send each packet next.
            Packets may take different paths to reach the destination (best path based on speed, load, or cost).

        Arrival and Reassembly:
            At the destination, packets are collected and reassembled in order using their sequence numbers.
            Missing or corrupted packets are requested again using protocols like TCP.

        Acknowledgment (if TCP):
        The receiver sends back an ACK (Acknowledgment) to confirm successful delivery.
