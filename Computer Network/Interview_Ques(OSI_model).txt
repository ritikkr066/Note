1.  Protocols in the Application Layer (Layer 7 of OSI Model)?
    "The Application Layer protocols enable end-user services like browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP, IMAP), file transfer (FTP), name resolution (DNS), and more. They support communication between client-server apps using protocols that follow either TCP or UDP, depending on the use case."

2. What is DNS (Domain Name System)?
    DNS translates domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.77.68) so browsers can load websites.

3. Why Does DNS Use UDP and Not TCP (by Default)?
    ✅ UDP is Faster: DNS queries are typically small (less than 512 bytes), so UDP is used to avoid connection overhead.
    ✅ No Handshake Needed: UDP sends requests directly, making it faster for quick lookups.

     But DNS can also use TCP:
     Used when: Response size > 512 bytes 
    
4. Address Resolution in DNS (How DNS Works)
    DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names like google.com into IP addresses. When a client wants to access a website, it first asks the local DNS resolver for the IP address. If it’s not already cached, the resolver contacts the root DNS server, which directs it to the relevant Top Level Domain (TLD) server—like .com for google.com. The TLD server then points to the authoritative DNS server for that domain, which finally responds with the actual IP address. The resolver caches this IP to speed up future requests and returns it to the client, enabling the browser to connect to the web server.

    ✅ Simplified Flow:
    Client → Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative → IP → Client

5. What is DNS Spoofing / DNS Cache Poisoning?
    In DNS spoofing, an attacker sends a fake DNS response to a resolver before the real one arrives. The resolver then caches the fake IP address, so when users type a correct website name, they’re redirected to a malicious site without knowing it.

6. Types of DNS Attacks?
    🛡️ Attack Type	         Description
    DNS Spoofing	       attackers send fake IP responses to DNS resolvers, causing users to be redirected to malicious websites.
    DNS Tunneling	       a method where malware or stolen data is hidden inside DNS queries and responses to bypass firewalls
    Domain Hijacking        occurs when attackers  change the ownership or DNS settings of a domain, effectively taking control of it.    

7. How DHCP Dynamically Assigns an IP Address to a Host
    The process is known as DORA:
    Discover → Offer → Request → Acknowledge

    1. Discover (Client → Broadcast)
    When a device connects to a network, it sends a DHCP Discover message.
    It’s a broadcast request: “Is there any DHCP server out there?”

    2. Offer (Server → Broadcast)
    A DHCP server replies with a DHCP Offer.
    It offers an available IP address and other config (subnet mask, gateway, lease time, etc.).

    3. Request (Client → Broadcast)
    The client sends a DHCP Request, indicating it wants the offered IP.

    4. Acknowledge (Server → Broadcast)
    The DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledgement (ACK).
    Confirms the IP is now leased to the client.

8.  What is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing?
    In P2P sharing, devices (called peers) communicate and share resources directly with each other without a central server.

9. What is an IP Address?
    An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, used to locate and communicate with other devices.

10.  What is a Supernet?
   A supernet is created by combining two or more contiguous subnets into a larger network. This process, known as supernetting, is mainly used to reduce the size of routing tables by summarizing multiple IP routes into a single route. This not only simplifies the routing process but also improves network performance and efficiency.

11. WPA vs WPS – What's the Difference?
    WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a security protocol used to encrypt data on wireless networks, protecting it from eavesdropping and unauthorized access. In contrast, WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) is a convenience feature that lets users connect to Wi-Fi without typing a password, often by pressing a button or entering a PIN. While WPA provides real security, WPS is known to be insecure due to brute-force vulnerabilities

12. What is AAA?
    AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, and it is a fundamental security framework in networking
    AAA stands for:
        Authentication : verifies who the user is, such as through a username and password
        Authorization : determines what the user is allowed to do, like accessing specific files or network services.
        Accounting :  tracks user activity and resource usage, such as login times and commands executed.

13. What is SONET?(Synchronous Optical Network)
   SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) is a standardized communication protocol used to transmit multiple digital data streams over optical fiber using technologies like lasers or LEDs. It allows different types of data—like voice, video, and internet traffic—to be multiplexed and sent together efficiently at high speeds.

14. What is ACL (Access Control List)?
    An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules used in routers and firewalls to control network traffic by specifying which packets should be allowed or denied based on factors like IP address, protocol, or port number. 

15.  What is Ethernet?
    It defines how data is transmitted over cables between devices like computers, switches, and routers.
     It operates at Layer 1 (Physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link) of the OSI model.

16  Internet vs Intranet vs Extranet
    Internet: Open to everyone (public).
    Intranet: Internal use only (private company network).
    Extranet: Intranet shared securely with specific outsiders.

    "The Internet is a public global network used by anyone. An Intranet is a private network within an organization, used by employees to access internal tools and documents. An Extranet is an extension of an intranet that allows secure access to external users like partners or vendors. It enables collaboration without exposing the full internal network."

17. Virtual Circuit vs Datagram Network ?
    A virtual circuit network is connection-oriented, meaning it sets up a dedicated path before sending data, ensuring packets arrive in order. In contrast, a datagram network like the Internet is connectionless — each packet may take a different route, and they may arrive out of order or get lost. Datagram networks are more flexible, while virtual circuits offer better reliability."

18. What is a Switch?
    A network switch is a Layer 2 device in the OSI model that connects multiple devices within a Local Area Network (LAN) and forwards data based on MAC addresses. Unlike a hub that broadcasts data to all connected devices, a switch intelligently sends data only to the intended recipient, which improves both security and efficiency.Switches help reduce network congestion and enable faster communication within the network.
    There are different types of switches, such as unmanaged switches (simple plug-and-play) and managed switches (which offer control, monitoring, and VLAN support).

19. What is a Virtual LAN (VLAN)?
   A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a technology that lets network administrators logically group devices regardless of their physical location. VLANs are often used in organizations to separate departments—like keeping HR, Finance, and IT on different virtual networks—even though they share the same physical infrastructure.

20.  What is Wi-Fi?
    "Wi-Fi is a wireless technology that connects devices to a network using radio waves. It’s based on IEEE 802.11 standards and allows access to the internet without physical cables. Wi-Fi uses frequencies like 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, and modern standards like Wi-Fi 6 offer high speed and efficiency. It’s secured using protocols like WPA2 and WPA3.

21. Web vs Internet ?
    "The Internet is the physical and logical infrastructure of global computer networks. The Web, or World Wide Web, is a service built on top of the Internet that uses HTTP to access and view websites through browsers. So, the Web is a part of the Internet, but the Internet also supports many other services like email and file transfers."
