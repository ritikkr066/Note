AUROC: it is metric which is used to measure the performance of classification.
    it mean how well it can distinguish between two classes i.e human generated and machine-generated.

HumanRec : it mean how well AI detection method correctly identies human-written text.

MAchineRec : it mean how well AI detection method correctly identies AI generated text.

RESULT:-

#In-Domain Detection
    "When the detection model was trained and tested on the same domain,performance is good.
    Longformer, achieved high AUROC, meaning it can easily separate AI-generated text from human-written text.

# Out-of-Domain Detection 
    When the detector was tested on new topics that it had never seen before, its accuracy dropped significantly.
    Longformer still performed best, but its HumanRec score dropped, meaning many human-written texts were misclassified as AI-generated.

#Unseen Models & Unseen Domains
 "When we introduced AI-generated text from an entirely new model,GPT-4,Longformer still performed well with an AUROC of 0.94.
    After fine-tuning the detection threshold, accuracy improved to 86.54%. However, human-written text was still sometimes misclassified as AI-generated."

#Paraphrasing Attacks
    When AI-generated text was slightly rewritten, detection accuracy dropped drastically.
    Longformer’s AUROC dropped from 0.94 to 0.75, meaning paraphrased AI-generated text often went undetected.


    ANANLYSIS

After evaluating the detection models, They conducted a deeper analysis to understand what makes AI-generated text different from human-written text.

#Convergence of Human and Machine Compositions
    They analyzed various linguistic features and found that AI-generated text differs from human text in specific domains
        when they collected adequate amount of data from various domains they found that there is not much different is these two text sources.

#The Double-Edged Sword of Perplexity Bias
    "One common way to detect AI-generated text is by using perplexity,which measures how predictable a sentence is.
     AI-generated text usually has lower perplexity, making it easier to detect.
     However, some human-written texts also have low perplexity, leading to misclassifications.
     when AI-generated text is paraphrased, its perplexity increases, making it appear more human-written and bypassing detection."

    CONCLUSION

AI detection works well in limited domains but fails when encountering new topics or writing styles.
Among all method Longformer perform  better with avgRec of 86.54%.
