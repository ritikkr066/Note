Q. Introduce yourself

Sure, I'm Ritik , currently in my fourth year of pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science. I've developed a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development, and I've been actively involved in projects like trialshopy, hospital management that enhance my technical and problem-solving skills. Where I was responsible for UI design, Frontend and Backend development . I used technology  like ReactJs, Nodejs, ExpressJs MongoDB to build scalable and efficient solutions.  I'm excited to bring my skills and passion into a practical environment and contribute effectively to impactful projects."

"Hi, I’m Ritik, currently in my final year of B.Tech in Computer Science At NIT PATNA.
I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and algorithms, and I regularly solve coding problems to improve my problem-solving skills.
I’ve also worked on projects like TrialShopy and a Hospital Management System, where I handled both frontend and backend .
I am comfortable with technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB and i used them  to build scalable and efficient web applications.
Now, I’m looking forward to applying my skills in a real-world environment where i can contribute  to meaningful projects and continue learning."

Q. What are your strengths?
"One of my main strengths is problem-solving. I enjoy solving complex problems and finding efficient solutions, as it helps me improve my thinking skills.
Another strength is consistency — I make sure to study every day, even if it’s just for a short time. I believe regular practice is key to improvement.
I’m also hardworking — I always try to finish my work on time and give my best in everything I do.
These strengths help me stay focused and improve a little every day."

Q.  Your Weakness ?
One of my weaknesses is that I used to speak very fast during presentations or discussions, which sometimes made it difficult for others to follow. I've been practicing slowing down and improving my communication.
Another  weakness is that sometimes I spend too much time trying to make things perfect, especially in projects or assignments. I’ve realized that it’s better to focus on completing the task first, then improve it later.
I’m also working on becoming more comfortable speaking in large groups, and I try to take every opportunity to practice and improve.

Q. Tell Me About a Project” (HealthDebug)
I’m currently working solo on a project called HealthDebug, which is a healthcare platform for booking doctor appointments, ordering medicines, and reading medical blogs
I started this project in April 2024, and I’m handling both the frontend and backend development.
On the frontend, I’m using React.js with Redux for state management
I’ve implemented role-based access for patients, doctors, and admins, and used lazy loading and caching to improve performance.
On the backend, I’m using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
I also helped develop an appointment booking system, where patients could book visits with offline doctors.
For medicine ordering, we integrated the PhonePe API for secure payments.
We also secured the platform using JWT-based authentication for proper role management.
Working solo on this project has helped me improve my full-stack skills, time management, and problem-solving — and I’ve learned a lot about building scalable web apps from scratch.


Q.  Why Should We Hire You?
You should hire me because I bring strong problem-solving skills, consistent learning habits, and hands-on project experience.
I’ve worked on full-stack projects like HealthDebug, where I handled both frontend and backend on my own using technologies like React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.
I’m also someone who learns daily — I regularly solve DSA problems and keep improving my technical and communication skills.
I may be a fresher, but I’m hardworking, quick to adapt, and truly excited to contribute and grow in a real-world development environment.


Q. : “Describe a challenge and how you overcame it.”
	TECHNICAL
One challenge I faced was during the development of my HealthDebug project. I was working solo and had to integrate the PhonePe payment API for the medicine ordering system.
At first, I struggled because the official documentation was limited, and I hadn't worked with payment gateways before.
To overcome this, I spent time reading external blogs, watching tutorials, and testing different approaches. After a few days of trial and error, I was able to successfully integrate the API and make secure transactions work.
This experience taught me how to learn independently, stay patient, and keep trying even when things get tough.

NON-TECHNICAL
A non-technical challenge I faced was during my second year in the Hacksmiths Club, when I became a senior and had to guide and communicate with new junior members.
Many of them were excited to learn everything quickly, but they were also confused about where to start.
At first, I found it difficult to explain things clearly and manage their expectations.
To solve this, I created a simple roadmap for web development, starting from HTML/CSS to backend with Node.js.
I also made sure to check in with them regularly and answer their questions patiently.
This experience helped me become a better communicator and mentor, and it taught me how to guide others step by step.



Q. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?”
In the next 5 years, I see myself as a skilled and reliable software developer, working on meaningful projects in a company where I can grow and contribute.
I want to keep improving my technical skills, especially in full-stack development and system design.
I also hope to take on more responsibilities, like mentoring juniors or leading small teams.
My main goal is to stay consistent in learning and become someone the team can trust to solve problems and deliver results.
