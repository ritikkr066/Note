Q. Can you explain what inheritance is in OOP with a simple example?
    “Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where one class (called the child class) inherits the properties and behaviors of another class (called the parent class). This allows code reusability and makes the code more organized.

    For example, if we have a class called Vehicle with common properties like speed and fuel, we can create a child class called Car that inherits those properties and can also have extra features like air conditioning or music system.”
