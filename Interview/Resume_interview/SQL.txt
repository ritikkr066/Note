Q. What are the different types of JOINs in SQL? Can you explain them with examples?
    In SQL, JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
    1. INNER JOIN
        Returns only the matching rows from both tables.
        Acts like an intersection.
    2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
        Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
        If no match is found, NULL is returned from the right table.

    3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
        Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.

    4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
        Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.
        Missing values are filled with NULLs.
    
Q. What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP in SQL?
    In SQL:
    DELETE is used to remove specific rows from a table based on a condition.
        🔹 Example: DELETE FROM Students WHERE id = 5;
        It can be rolled back if used within a transaction.

    TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table, but keeps the table structure.
        🔹 It’s faster than DELETE and cannot be rolled back in some databases.
        🔹 Example: TRUNCATE TABLE Students;

    DROP is used to delete the entire table or database permanently.
        🔹 It removes the structure too.
        🔹 Example: DROP TABLE Students;

Q. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses in SQL?
    WHERE is used to filter rows before grouping, and HAVING is used to filter groups after the GROUP BY clause.
        WHERE works on individual rows.
        HAVING works on grouped data.
