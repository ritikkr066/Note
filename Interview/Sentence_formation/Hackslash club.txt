Experiance

Good morning everyone.
Today I want to share my two-year journey with the Hacksmiths Club.
I joined the club in July 2024 during my first year of engineering after the induction process.
At first, I attended an orientation where I got to know the team and interacted with seniors.
Working closely with them gave me useful insights and hands-on experience.
Later that year, I got a chance to work on a project during TCF, where I collaborated with a junior to build the project.
That was a great learning experience for me.

In my second year, I became a senior member of the club.
I was responsible for interviewing new juniors and guiding them in their learning journey.
Many juniors were excited to learn everything quickly, so we helped them by giving a clear timeline and roadmap.

My simple roadmap for web development goes like this:
First, learn HTML and CSS, and make small projects.
Once you're comfortable, move to JavaScript and use it in your projects.
Then learn frameworks like ReactJS, NextJS, and styling tools like Tailwind CSS.
If you feel confident with frontend, start learning the backend with Node.js and Express.js.
Try building pages like login and signup.
Then learn MongoDB and connect it to your projects.
This step-by-step process has worked well for many juniors.

That was my experience in the Hacksmiths Club, and I’m grateful for the learning and growth it brought me. Thank you!
