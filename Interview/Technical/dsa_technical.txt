1. How would you count the number of vowels in a string ?
    First, I’d create a set of vowels like a, e, i, o, u.
    Then I’d loop through the string and for each character, check if it’s in the vowel set.
    If it is, I’d increase a counter.
    Finally, I’d return the counter as the number of vowels.
    This approach runs in O(n) time and is simple to implement.

2.  How would you reverse a given string ?
    I would convert the string into a character array or use a StringBuilder.
    Then, I’d swap characters from both ends using two pointers until they meet.
    This gives the reversed string in O(n) time.

3.  How do you check if a string reads the same forward and backward?
    I’ll use two pointers — one at the start and one at the end.
    I’ll compare characters while moving inward.
    If all characters match, it’s a palindrome.

4.  Find the largest number in an array?
    I’d loop through the array and keep a variable to store the maximum value.
    If any element is greater than the current max, I update it.
    This is done in one pass, O(n) time.

5.  Find the frequency of each character in a string
    I’d use a HashMap or object to store character counts.
    For each character, I increase its count.
    This way I get the frequency of every letter in O(n) time.

6. Check if two strings are anagrams?
    I’d sort both strings and compare.
    If they’re equal after sorting, they are anagrams.
    Alternatively, I can count character frequencies and compare the maps.

7.  Count digits in a number?
    I’d divide the number by 10 in a loop and count how many times it runs.
    Each division removes one digit.

8. Check if a number is prime ? 
    I’d check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to sqrt(n).
    If it is, it’s not prime.
    Otherwise, it is.

9. Find the sum of digits in a number?
    I’d use a loop to get each digit using % 10 and keep adding it.
    Then divide the number by 10 to remove that digit.

10. Check if an array contains duplicates ?
    I’d use a Set.
    While looping through the array, if I see an element that’s already in the Set, I return true.
    Otherwise, I add it to the Set.

11. Find second largest element in an array?
    I’d keep two variables — one for the largest and one for second largest.
    As I loop through the array, I update them based on comparisons.

12. Find the first non-repeating character in a string?
    First, I’d use a HashMap to count the frequency of each character.
    Then, I’d go through the string again and return the first character with frequency 1.

13. Find the missing number in an array of size n-1 ?
    I’d calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula n*(n+1)/2,
    then subtract the sum of array elements.
    The difference is the missing number.

14. Move all zeros to the end of the array?
    I’d use two pointers — one to track non-zero elements and another to place them in order.
    After that, I’d fill the rest of the array with zeros.

15. Find all pairs in an array that sum up to a given number?
    I’d use a HashSet to store visited elements.
    For each number, I’d check if the target minus that number is already in the set.
    If yes, it’s a valid pair.

16. Check if a string is a rotation of another? 
    I’d concatenate the original string to itself (like "abcdabcd")
    Then check if the second string exists as a substring.
    If yes, it’s a rotation.

17. Find the majority element in an array (appears more than n/2 times) ?
    I’d use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.
    It keeps a count and a candidate.
    If the count drops to zero, we change the candidate.
    At the end, we check if the candidate appears more than n/2 times.

18. Check if a number is a power of 2?
    I’d use bitwise logic — if the number is greater than 0 and n & (n - 1) is 0,
    then it’s a power of 2.

19. Find the longest word in a sentence ? 
    I’d split the sentence by spaces into words,
    then loop through them to find the one with the maximum length.

20.  Check if a string has all unique characters
    I’d use a Set. If I find any repeating character while looping, I return false.
    If no duplicates are found, the string has all unique characters.
