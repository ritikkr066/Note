Q. Should CGPA be considered creteria for selection process?

ANSWER:
CGPA should not be a deciding factor in interviews; it should only serve as an eligibility criterion. Just like how a 75% score in school exams is required for admission into IITs and NITs, CGPA can act as a basic standard to filter candidates, but it doesn’t reflect all the skills and qualities needed for a job. Many important skills, like problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and practical knowledge, are not always shown by a high CGPA. Therefore, relying too much on CGPA can overlook talented candidates who may perform well in real-world situations but may not have a top score on paper.

Q. Interviewer: "Is the filter method based on the Trie data structure?"

You:
"No, the filter method is not based on the Trie data structure. The filter method is a general-purpose array method in JavaScript that allows you to create a new array by checking if each element meets a specific condition. It works by going through each element in the array and applying the condition.

On the other hand, a Trie is a specialized data structure used for storing strings efficiently. It's particularly useful when you need operations like autocomplete or searching for words that share a common prefix. Tries are much more efficient than using filter when you need to search through a large number of strings or handle prefix-based searches.

Question: What role do data structures play in web development? Can you provide examples of their usage?

Answer:

"Data structures are fundamental in web development as they help organize and manipulate data efficiently, which is critical for building responsive and scalable applications. For example, arrays and objects are commonly used in the frontend to manage state and render data dynamically. In React, we often use arrays with methods like map() to iterate over and display lists of items such as products or user comments.

On the backend, hash tables (or objects/maps) are widely used for fast data lookups, such as retrieving user sessions or storing cookies. For instance, when implementing authentication, we can store user data in a hash table for constant-time access.

Another example is the use of trees in representing hierarchical data like the DOM or navigation menus. For search functionalities, we use data structures like Tries to efficiently store and retrieve suggestions for autocomplete.
