Q1. What is React?
    React is a JavaScript library especially used for creation of single-page applications (SPAs). It is used to create reusable, interactive UI components for web and mobile applications.

    Key Features of React:
        Component-Based Architecture: Breaks the UI into smaller, reusable components.
        Virtual DOM: Efficiently updates and renders components by maintaining a lightweight representation of the DOM.
        Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows from parent to child components, which simplifies debugging and state management.

Q2. Relation Between HTML and DOM?

    1.HTML is the Input:
    HTML is the static markup language that defines the structure, content, and layout of a webpage.

    2.Browser Parses HTML:
    When a browser loads an HTML document, it reads the HTML code and parses it to create the DOM (Document Object Model).

    3.DOM is the Output:
    The browser constructs a tree-like structure (DOM tree) from the parsed HTML. This DOM structure represents the document in memory, enabling dynamic interaction
