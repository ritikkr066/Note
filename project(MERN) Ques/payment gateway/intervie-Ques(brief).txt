#General Payment Gateway Questions

1. What is a payment gateway?
   - It helps process online payments securely between customers, merchants, and banks.

2. How do you ensure security?
   - Use HTTPS, encrypt data with SHA256, and store keys securely (like in environment variables).

3. What fields are needed for a payment request?
   - Merchant ID, Transaction ID, Amount, Redirect URL, and Security Hash.

4. What is the `X-VERIFY` header?
   - It proves the request is valid, created by hashing the payload and other details.

5. What if a payment fails?
   - Show a clear failure message, let the user retry, and use the status API to confirm the result.

 Technical Questions

6. Why use base64 and SHA256?
   - Base64 makes data safe to send, and SHA256 ensures the data hasn’t been changed.

7. How to validate the payment response?
   - Check the status, verify the hash, and match transaction details.

8. What if the `redirectUrl` doesn’t work?
   - Use a `callbackUrl` to get the status directly on the server.

9. Why is `merchantTransactionId` important?
   - It prevents confusion by uniquely identifying each transaction.

10. How to debug payment issues?
    - Check logs, verify the payload, and test using sandbox (test) mode.

 Error Handling

11. What happens if `X-VERIFY` is wrong?
    - The gateway rejects the request, so recheck your hash logic.

12. How to handle duplicate requests?
    - Use the same `merchantTransactionId` to check the original transaction status.

13. What if the gateway is down?
    - Retry with delays and notify users of the issue.

14. How to avoid fraud?
    - Validate user details, limit retries, and use fraud checks.

15. How to secure redirect and callback URLs?
    - Use HTTPS and verify incoming requests with a hash.

 Concepts

16. Difference between `redirectUrl` and `callbackUrl`:
   - `redirectUrl`: Brings the user back after payment.
   - `callbackUrl`: Informs your server about the payment result.

17. What is idempotency?
   - It ensures repeated requests don’t process the same payment twice.

18. Why use `SALT_INDEX`?
   - It tells the gateway which key to use for validation.

19. How to secure keys?
   - Store them in environment variables, not in your code.

20. Handling success, error, and pending statuses:
   - Success: Show a thank-you page.
   - Error: Allow retries.
   - Pending: Inform the user to check later.
