1. Explain Virtual DOM and how it works?
    “The Virtual DOM is just a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React keeps in memory. Instead of directly changing the real DOM every time something updates, React first updates this Virtual DOM.

    Then React compares the Virtual DOM with the previous version (this process is called diffing). After finding the differences, React only updates the specific parts of the real DOM that changed.

    This makes React apps faster because it avoids reloading the whole page or making too many changes to the real DOM.”

    Q. Why virtual DOM is lightweight copy? 
        The real DOM (Document Object Model) is the browser’s actual representation of the webpage. Changing it frequently is slow, because the browser has to repaint and re-render the UI.

        The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is just a JavaScript object copy of the real DOM. It’s like a lightweight blueprint of the UI.
        It doesn’t have heavy browser features like layout, styles, rendering engine.
        It’s only a plain JavaScript tree structure (just objects), which is super cheap to create and update in memory.

2. what is state management in React ?

    “State management in React means handling the data of the app and making sure the UI updates when that data changes.

    For example, if I have a counter, the number shown depends on the state. When I click the button, the state changes, and React automatically re-renders the UI.

    For small apps, I can use useState or useReducer. But when the app grows bigger, and data needs to be shared across many components (like user login info, cart data), I use tools like Context API or Redux.

    So basically, state management is all about keeping the app’s data in sync with the UI in an organized way.”


3. what are some of the compulsory used hooks in React?
    A hook in React is just a special function that lets you use React features in your components.

    -> Some of the most commonly used hooks in React are:
        useState – to store and update state in a component (like counter, form values).
        useEffect – to handle side effects (like fetching data from an API, running code after render).
        useContext – to access global data without passing props manually (like theme or login info).
        useReducer – for more complex state logic (like handling cart items or multiple actions).
        useRef – to reference DOM elements or keep values between renders without re-rendering.

4. Explain the component lifecycle in React ?

    The component lifecycle  is sequence of events that happen to a component from its creation(mounting) to its removal(unmounting).

    1. mounting : constructor()  render()  componentDidMount()
    2. updating : shouldComponentUpdate() render() componentDidUpdate()
    3. unmounting : componentWillUnmount()

    Mounting : when the component is created and inserted into the DOM.
    Updating : when the component's state or props change
    Unmounting : Shutting down the process

5. What is context API , and how is it different from props ?
   The Context API in React is used to share data between components without passing it down manually through props at every level.
    For example, if I have a logged-in user’s info (like name or role), instead of sending it from parent → child → grandchild through props, I can store it in Context. Then, any component can directly use it.

    Difference from props:
    Props → Data is passed from parent to child step by step.
    Context API → Data can be accessed anywhere in the component tree without that step-by-step passing..


6. How can you optimise Performance within a React application?

    Optimizing Performance in a React Application:
    1.Use React.memo:- Prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing functional components.
        eg. const OptimizedComponent = memo(({ data }) => <div>{data}</div>);
    
    2.Use useCallback and useMemo:-
        useCallback: Memoizes functions to avoid re-creation during re-renders.
        useMemo: Memoizes computed values.
        eg. const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
            const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => doSomething(a), [a]);

    3.Code-Splitting and Lazy Loading:-Load components and modules only when needed.

    4.Avoid Anonymous Functions in JSX:-Avoid inline functions that can cause unnecessary re-renders.
        // Bad
        <button onClick={() => handleClick()}>Click</button>
        // Good
        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {...}, []);
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>

7. What do you mean by higher-order component in React?
    A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React is just a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with extra features.

8. How do you handle forms in React ?
      In React, I handle forms using controlled components. That means each input field has a state, and its value comes from React state instead of the DOM. I use useState to store input values and update them with onChange. Then, when the form is submitted, I can easily access all values from the state.

9. What is server-side rendering , how is it beneficial?
    Server-Side Rendering (SSR) means the webpage is generated on the server instead of the browser. So when a user visits the site, they get a fully ready HTML page instead of waiting for JavaScript to load and build the UI.

    Server-side rendering(SSR) is a Technique where a web pages is rendered on the server before it sent to the user's browser.

    Client-Side Rendering means the browser builds the page using JavaScript after downloading it. At first, the server only sends an empty HTML file with a script tag, and then React (or any JS framework) runs on the client’s browser to render the UI.

        eg. Times of India uses SSR . all content already loaded
            Instagram uses CSR(client-side rendering based on user preference)

    Advantages:-
        Faster initial load – because the page is ready when it reaches the browser.
        Better SEO – search engines can easily read the HTML content.
        Good for slow devices – since the heavy work is done on the server, not the user’s browser.

10. What do you understand by Redux in React ?
   Redux is a state management library for React. It helps keep the app’s data in one central store so that any component can access it without passing props everywhere.

    For example, instead of sending user login info or cart data through multiple components, I keep it in Redux. Then any component (like Navbar, Cart Page, Checkout Page) can directly use it.

    So, Redux makes state centralized, predictable, and easy to debug.

11. client-side rendering  and server-side rendering
    CSR:- web app with more users or more interactivity
        Dynamic websites
    
    SSR:- static websites
        web app with less users or less interactivity.
        full Documentation rebuild(while refreshing).

        Client-Side Rendering (CSR):
        In client-side rendering, the browser first loads a blank HTML page with JavaScript files. Then React (or another framework) runs in the browser to build the UI. This makes navigation between pages very fast after the first load, because only data changes are fetched, not the whole page. But the first load can be slow, and SEO (search engine optimization) is weaker since the content is rendered in the browser, not on the server.

        Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
        In server-side rendering, the server builds the full HTML page with all the data and sends it to the browser. This makes the first page load faster and is better for SEO because search engines can read the content easily. After that, React takes over on the client side for interactions. The drawback is that it can put more load on the server.
