1. Technique: Two-Pass Greedy with Local Comparisons
    ✅ When to Use
    When each element in an array/list depends on its neighbors (left/right).

    When constraints are like:
    "If a[i] > a[i-1], then f[i] > f[i-1]", and
    "If a[i] > a[i+1], then f[i] > f[i+1]"
    When you must minimize or maximize an array based on such local rules.
