Leetcode:-279
	Q.Interviewer: "How would you approach finding the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to n?"

	Ans:-"I’d start by recognizing that this problem is about reaching n with the fewest steps, where each step can be a perfect square. This hints at either a dynamic programming solution, where we build up to n using smaller values, or a BFS approach where each level represents one more perfect square added. I’ll go with the DP approach for simplicity in tracking our solutions.

"In DP, I’ll create an array dp where each index represents the minimum number of squares to reach that index. Each entry will be initialized to infinity, except dp[0] = 0 because no squares are needed for 0.

"For each number i from 1 to n, I’ll look at every square number j^2 such that j^2 <= i, updating dp[i] with the minimum of its current value or dp[i - j^2] + 1. This means I’m trying each possible perfect square at every step to build up to the best solution for i."
