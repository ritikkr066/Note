SOLID 
    S: Single responsibility principle(SRP)
    O: Open-close principle (OCP)
    L: Liskov Substituition principle (LSP)
    I: Interface Segragation principle (ISP)
    D: Dependecy Inversion principle(DIP)

S : Single Responsibility Principle 
    A class should have only one reason to change
    A class should do only one thing 
    Meaning: Each class should handle only one functionality or responsibility.

O : Open- close Principle
    A class should open for extension but close for modification
    Meaning: You should be able to add new features without modifying existing code.

L : Liskov Substituition Principle
    subclass should be Substituition for their base classes.
    Meaning: If class B is a child of class A, then objects of A should be replaceable with B without breaking functionality.

I : Interface Segregation Principle
    Many client specific are better than one general purpose interface.
    Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
    Meaning: Create smaller, specific interfaces instead of one big interface.

D : Dependecy Inversion Principle
    High level module should not depend on low level module but rather both should depend on abstraction.
    Meaning: Code should depend on interfaces/abstractions rather than concrete classes.
