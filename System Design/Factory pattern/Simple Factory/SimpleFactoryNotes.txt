In Simple Words:
    You tell the factory what burger you want (“standard”).
    The factory decides which class to use and creates it.
    You don’t need to know how or which class — you just get a Burger object.
    Then you call prepare(), and it behaves according to the burger type.

Q4. What principle does this follow?
    Encapsulation: Object creation logic is encapsulated in one class.
    Single Responsibility Principle: The factory has the sole responsibility of creating objects.

Q5. What are the drawbacks of Simple Factory?
    ❌ Violates Open/Closed Principle — if you add a new burger type, you must modify the factory code.
    ❌ Factory can grow large if too many types are handled.

Structure : 
    Interface → Concrete Classes → Factory → Client

Eg. 
    Client → BurgerFactory.createBurger("standard") → returns new StandardBurger()
