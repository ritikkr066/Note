Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients, queue requests, and support undo/redo.

3️⃣ What happens when you press the button
    remote.press(button);

    Step-by-step
        Remote says:
        “I don’t know what this does, I’ll just call execute()”
        LightOnCommand.execute() is called
        Inside:
        livingRoomLight.on();
        Light turns ON 💡
        Remote is decoupled from Light.

4️⃣ Undo — why this is powerful
    remote.undo();

    What happens?
        Remote remembers last executed command
        Calls:
        lastCommand.undo();
        LightOnCommand.undo():
        livingRoomLight.off();
        Light turns OFF ❌💡
        Real life:
        You press “undo” on remote → last action is reversed

Command pattern is not only for undo.
Undo is optional.
Command’s real purpose is decoupling sender from receiver.
