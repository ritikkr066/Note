Factory Method defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Factory Method replaces conditional logic with polymorphism.

Q1. Where is the factory method?
    protected abstract Notification createNotification();

Q2. Why is it protected, not public?
    So subclasses can override it, but client cannot directly call it.

Q3. Why abstract class instead of interface?
    Because creator contains shared business logic (notifyUser) in addition to the factory method.

Q4. Does this follow SOLID?
    ✔ OCP – new type → new subclass
    ✔ DIP – depends on abstraction
    ✔ SRP – creation separated

Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for object creation, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
It eliminates conditional logic and supports Open–Closed Principle using polymorphism.
