Does Builder make sense without Pizza?
❌ No
✔️ It exists only to create Pizza
    That’s the biggest reason it’s nested.
    Nested class = “logically belongs to outer class”

4️⃣ Why is Pizza constructor private?
    private Pizza(Builder builder)

    This ensures:
    Pizza can be created only via Builder
    No half-baked objects

How can Builder call a private constructor?
    👉 Because it’s inside the same class
    This is intentional design, not coincidence.

5️⃣ Why Builder is static nested class (important)
    public static class Builder

    Why static?
    Builder does NOT need an existing Pizza instance
    It avoids holding implicit reference to Pizza

Static nested classes are accessed using:
    OuterClass.InnerClass // new Pizza.Builder()


3️⃣ What happens step-by-step (important for confidence)
    new Pizza.Builder()
        ✔ Creates an empty builder object
    .size("L")
        ✔ Sets builder.size = "L"
    .addCheese()
        ✔ Sets cheese = true
    .build()
        calls new Pizza(this)
    
    ✔ Pizza constructor copies values from builder
    ✔ Final immutable object created

“Builder postpones object creation until all configuration is done.”
