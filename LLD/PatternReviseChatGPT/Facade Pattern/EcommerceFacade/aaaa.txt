“How do you simplify a complex system for clients?”
    Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

2️⃣ Problem It Solves (Why we need it)
    Inventory inventory = new Inventory();
    Payment payment = new Payment();
    Shipping shipping = new Shipping();

    if (inventory.checkStock()) {
        payment.makePayment();
        shipping.shipOrder();
    }

    we do : Book ticket
    we don't do :Check seat
                Reserve seat
                Pay
                Generate ticket
                Send email

3️⃣ Structure (IMPORTANT)
    Client → Facade → Subsystem Classes
        Client knows only Facade
        Subsystems remain unchanged

❓ “Does Facade add new functionality?”
❌ No
✔ It only organizes and simplifies access
