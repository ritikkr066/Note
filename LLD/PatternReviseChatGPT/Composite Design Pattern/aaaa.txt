“How do you treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly?”
    Composite Pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Sometimes you want to treat a single object and a group of objects in the same way.

2️⃣ WITHOUT Composite
    What if:
    Folder contains another folder?
    Or folder contains mix of files + folders?

        if (item instanceof File) { ... }
        else if (item instanceof Folder) { ... }
    
    client code become :
        if(obj is File) {
            file.showSize();
        } else {
            folder.showSize();
        }

    💥 Problems:
    Client must know type
    instanceof everywhere
    Code breaks when new types added
    Violates Open–Closed Principle

3️⃣ Structure
    Component (interface)
    |
    Leaf (single object)
    |
    Composite (group of components)


4️⃣ MAGIC moment ✨
    👉 File and Folder are both FileSystem
    FileSystem x = file OR folder;
    x.showSize(); // SAME CALL

    💡 Client does not care if it's:
        Single object (File)
        Group of objects (Folder)

Company structure
    Employee → single
    Department → group of employees
        both have getSalary()
