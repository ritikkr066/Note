Extended ER Features ? 
    “Extended ER (EER) features are enhancements to the basic ER model that allow more complex and real-world data modeling. These features help represent inheritance, categorization, and specialization — concepts we often see in object-oriented systems.

    The main EER features include:

    1. Generalization – It is the process of extracting common characteristics from two or more entities and creating a generalized super-entity.
        For example, Car and Truck can be generalized into a common entity Vehicle.

    2. Specialization – It is the opposite of generalization. We take a higher-level entity and create more specific lower-level entities.
        For example, from Employee, we can specialize into Manager and Engineer.

    3. Inheritance – This means that a subclass (like Manager) inherits attributes and relationships of its superclass (like Employee).

    4. Aggregation – This is used when we treat a relationship as a higher-level entity.
        For example, if a Project is managed by an Employee and uses Resources, the ‘manages’ relationship itself can be considered as an abstract entity.
