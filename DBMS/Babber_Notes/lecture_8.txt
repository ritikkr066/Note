1. ER Model to Relational Model ?
    🔹 1. Entities → Tables\
        Each entity becomes a table.
        Its attributes become columns.
        Choose a primary key for each entity.
        Example: Entity Student(RollNo, Name, Age) → Table Student with RollNo as Primary Key.

    🔹 2. Relationships → Foreign Keys

        For 1:Many (1:N), add the primary key of the “1” side as a foreign key in the “N” side.

        For Many:Many (M:N), create a new table with foreign keys from both participating entities.

        For 1:1, you can choose either side to place the foreign key (depends on total participation).

        ✳️ Example:
        Student and Course have a many-to-many relationship (enrollment).
        You create:
            Student(RollNo, Name)
            Course(CourseID, Title)

        Enrollment(RollNo, CourseID) — where both are foreign keys and together form a composite primary key.

    🔹 3. Multivalued Attributes
        Create a separate table.
        Example: If a Student has multiple phone numbers → make a StudentPhone(RollNo, PhoneNo) table.

    🔹 4. Weak Entities
        Add them as a table with a foreign key to the strong entity + partial key.
        Example: Dependent(DependentName, EmpID) → EmpID is foreign key from Employee.
