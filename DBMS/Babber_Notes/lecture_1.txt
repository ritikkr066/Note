1. Data vs Information ?
    “Data and Information are closely related, but different.
    Data is the raw input — like numbers, words, or measurements — that has no meaning on its own. When we process that data, organize it, and give it context, it becomes information.

    For example, if we have numbers like 90, 85, 88, that’s data. But if we say 'These are marks of a student in Science', that becomes information.

    In real-world applications, data is collected from various sources, and through processing — like analysis or formatting — it is turned into information that helps in making decisions.”

2. What is database?
    “A database is a structured way to store and manage data on a computer so that it can be easily accessed, updated, or searched.

    For example, a school might use a database to store student details — like names, roll numbers, marks — and quickly retrieve any student’s data when needed.

    Databases are used everywhere — in banking systems, e-commerce apps, social media, and more — to store and manage huge amounts of information safely and efficiently.”

3. DBMS?
    “DBMS stands for Database Management System. It’s a software tool that helps us store, organize, and manage data efficiently.

    For example, MySQL or Oracle DBMS can be used by a bank to manage customer accounts and transactions.

4. DBMS vs file system ? 
    “A file system stores data in files and folders, but it lacks structure and is harder to search or manage when data grows large.

    DBMS, on the other hand, stores data in a structured format like tables and provides powerful features like querying, indexing, and security.

    For example, searching a student's record in a file system means going through multiple files, but in DBMS, we can just run a simple query.
