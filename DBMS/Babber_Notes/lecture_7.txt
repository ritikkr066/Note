1. Relational model ?
    “The Relational Model is the most widely used data model in modern databases. Each table consists of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).

    In this model, every row represents a unique record, and each column represents a field or property of that record.

    For example, a Student table might look like this:
            RollNo	Name	Age
            101	    Raj	    20
            102	    Simran	21
    Here, RollNo, Name, and Age are attributes; each row is a tuple.

    Key features of the Relational Model include:
    Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record (e.g., RollNo).

    Foreign Key: An attribute in one table that refers to the primary key of another (used to establish relationships).

    Integrity Constraints: Rules like Entity Integrity (no null in primary key) and Referential Integrity (foreign keys must match existing values).

    Relational Algebra: A set of operations (like SELECT, PROJECT, JOIN) used to retrieve and manipulate data.

    The relational model is simple, flexible, and powerful, which is why it’s used in most systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.

    A good analogy is: a relational database is like an Excel workbook where each sheet is a table, rows are records, and columns are fields — and we can easily connect data across sheets using unique identifiers.

    Overall, the relational model provides a strong foundation for organizing data logically, reducing redundancy, and enabling complex querying.”

2 Relational model keys ? 
    “In the relational model, keys are used to uniquely identify rows in a table and establish relationships between tables. They ensure data accuracy and integrity.

    There are several important types of keys:
    1. Primary Key –
        Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
        Cannot have NULL or duplicate values.
        Example: In a Student table, RollNo can be a primary key.

    2. Candidate Key –
        A set of fields that could all be used as a primary key.
        Out of multiple candidate keys, one is chosen as the primary key.
        Example: A student’s RollNo and Email might both be unique — both are candidate keys.

    3. Super Key –
        Any combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a row.
        All candidate keys are super keys, but not all super keys are candidate keys (some may have extra fields).

    4. Foreign Key –
        A field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.
        It establishes a relationship between two tables.
        Example: In an Enrollment table, StudentID can be a foreign key referencing the Student table.

    5. Composite Key –
        A key formed by combining two or more columns to uniquely identify a row.
        Used when no single column is unique.
        Example: A combination of StudentID and CourseID in a Registration table.

3. Constraints
     1. Key Constraints (Uniqueness Constraint)
        This ensures that primary keys are unique and not NULL.
        It guarantees that each row in a table can be uniquely identified.
        For example, no two students can have the same Roll Number in a Student table.

    🔹 2. Entity Integrity Constraint
        It applies specifically to primary keys.
        It says the primary key must have a value (cannot be NULL).
        This ensures that every record in a table can be identified.
        Think of it like: a national ID must exist for every citizen record.

    🔹 3. Referential Integrity Constraint
        It applies to foreign keys.
        It ensures that the value of a foreign key must match an existing value in the parent table or be NULL.
        For example, if StudentID in the Enrollment table refers to a Student table, then every StudentID must exist in the Student table.
