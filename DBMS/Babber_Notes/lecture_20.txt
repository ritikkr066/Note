Q. CAP Theorem ? 

    CAP Theorem is a fundamental concept in distributed databases that helps us understand the trade-offs when designing such systems. It stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. The theorem says that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of these three at the same time.

    Consistency means that all nodes return the same, latest data — no matter which one you read from. Availability means the system always gives a response, even if some nodes are down. Partition Tolerance means the system keeps working even when there's a network failure between nodes.

    In real-world systems, network issues (partitioning) are unavoidable, so we’re left to choose between Consistency and Availability. For example, MongoDB prefers Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP) — it may stop responding during a network failure to avoid wrong data, which is ideal in systems like banking. On the other hand, Cassandra prefers Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP) — it keeps responding even during network failures, which is okay in social media apps like Facebook where being slightly outdated is acceptable.

    CA systems, which focus on Consistency and Availability, are not ideal for distributed systems because they don't tolerate network issues well — traditional databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL follow this model.

    In short, CAP Theorem helps us decide what to prioritize based on our use case: consistency or availability — because partition tolerance is non-negotiable in distributed systems.
