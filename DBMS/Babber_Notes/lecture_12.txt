Q. Transactions and ACID properties ?

    A transaction in a database is a logical unit of work, consisting of one or more SQL operations like insert, update, or delete. These operations must be executed in a specific sequence to maintain correctness. The key idea is that either all the operations within a transaction are successfully completed and permanently saved in the database, or none of them take effect if any step fails. This ensures the database stays consistent.

    To guarantee the reliability of transactions, databases follow the ACID properties.

    Atomicity ensures that a transaction is all-or-nothing—if any part fails, the whole transaction is rolled back.

    Consistency means that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, always maintaining rules like constraints or relationships.

    Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions don’t interfere with each other. Each transaction behaves as if it’s the only one running, even when many are running at the same time.

    Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes will survive any system failure like power loss or crash.

    Transactions go through several states during their execution:

    In the Active state, the transaction begins and performs its read/write operations.

    If everything works fine, it enters the Partially Committed state, where changes are saved in memory but not yet permanent in the database.

    Once these changes are made permanent, the transaction enters the Committed state, and no rollback is possible from here.

    If any failure occurs during execution, the transaction enters a Failed state, and all temporary changes are discarded.

    After rollback, it moves to the Aborted state, restoring the database to the state before the transaction began.

    Finally, once the transaction either commits or aborts, it reaches the Terminated state.

    This entire flow ensures that even in the face of errors or system crashes, the database maintains correctness, stability, and reliability.
