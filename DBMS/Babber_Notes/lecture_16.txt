Q. Types of Databases
    There are several types of databases, each built for different needs. The most common is the Relational Database, which stores data in tables with rows and columns. These tables can be linked using keys, like primary and foreign keys, and we use SQL to interact with them. Examples include MySQL and Oracle. They are very good for structured data and ensure data consistency, but may face problems when dealing with huge amounts of data or when scaling horizontally. Then we have Object-Oriented Databases, which store data in the form of objects—similar to how data is handled in object-oriented programming. This is useful for complex data and real-world modeling, and it supports concepts like inheritance and encapsulation. However, it's not as widely used, and performance can be slower due to complexity. Examples include ObjectDB and GemStone.

    Next, we have NoSQL Databases, which don’t use tables. Instead, they store data in flexible formats like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-columns. They are best for handling large volumes of unstructured data and can scale out easily. They are schema-free, meaning they allow dynamic changes in data structure. Popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB and Cassandra. Hierarchical Databases organize data in a tree-like structure where each child has only one parent. It's fast for one-to-many relationships, like folders in Windows, but not good for complex relationships where children need multiple parents. An example is IBM IMS. Lastly, Network Databases are like an advanced version of hierarchical ones. Here, child nodes can have multiple parents, and relationships are stored in a graph format. While they can handle complex links, they are harder to manage and not commonly used today. Examples include IDMS and IDS.
