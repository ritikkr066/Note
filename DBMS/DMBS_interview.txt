What is Schedule?
    Collection of multiple transcations running on same databases.

What is concurrency?
    Concurrency in DBMS refers to multiple transactions executing at the same time while ensuring the correctness and consistency of the database.

Why concurrency?
    1. improved throughput:  number of transactions completed successfully per unit of time.
    2. Resource utilisation
    3. Reduced waiting time

problems with concurrency?
    1. 🔁 Lost Update:  Two transactions read the same data and update it, but one update overwrites the other.
    2. 🧪 Dirty Read:  Temporary update problem.
    3. 🔄 Non-Repeatable Read : : A transaction reads the same row twice, but gets different data due to another transaction's update in between.
    4. phantom read : A phantom read happens when a repeated query gives different results because new rows were added or deleted by another transaction during that tim

    Concurrency in DBMS can lead to issues like lost updates, dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. These problems occur when transactions interfere with each other without proper isolation.

Good vs Bad Schedule
    Good Schedule : Concurrent schedule which provide consistent result.

 What is a Serial Schedule in DBMS?
    A serial schedule is a type of transaction schedule where one transaction is executed completely before another starts.

Non-serial Schedule
    "A non-serial schedule is when multiple transactions’ operations are interleaved, allowing concurrent execution. This improves throughput but requires concurrency control to avoid consistency problems."

Serializable Schedule 
    A concurrent schedule which provide result as a serial schedule.
    A serializable schedule allows transactions to run concurrently but ensures the result is the same as some serial execution of those transactions. This maintains consistency while improving system throughput."

    🔄 Example:
    Suppose T1 and T2 both update account balances.
       Their operations can be interleaved (non-serial), but if the final balances are the same as if T1 ran fully before T2 (or vice versa), the schedule is serializable.

### Total possible serial schedule n is n! i.e if n=3 total=3!=6

Conflict
    2 databases statements are conflicts if and only if
        1. both are in different transactions.
        2. both are accessing the same data item
        3. Atleast one of them is write operation.

Conflict Equivalent:
    Two schedules are conflict equivalent if they have the same operations, and the order of all conflicting operations is the same in both schedules.

# If cycle is present in precedence graph then there is not conflict serializable
    if no cylce : serializable(conflict)

🔗 What is a Precedence Graph?
    A precedence graph is a directed graph used to check if a non-serial schedule is conflict serializable.

View Serializibility
    1. Who read from database.
    2. Who reads from other's written value.
    3. Who writes first

    2 schedule s1,s2 are view equivalent if both are following similar sequences/rules of view Serializibility

    A schedule is called view view schedule if it is view equivalentto any serial schedule.

🔁 What is a Recoverable Schedule?
    A recoverable schedule is a type of schedule in which a transaction commits only after all the transactions whose changes it has read have also committed.

🔄 What is Cascading Rollback?
    A cascading rollback occurs when the failure (abort) of one transaction causes other dependent transactions to also roll back, like a chain reaction.

✅ What is a Cascadeless Schedule?
    In a cascadeless schedule, no transaction reads data written by another uncommitted transaction.
