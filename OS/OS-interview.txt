Why Do We Need an Operating System (OS)?
    1. What if there is no OS?
    Imagine you’re building an app (like a game or browser) and there’s no OS. You’d face big problems:

        a. Bulky and Complex Apps
        Every app would need to include its own code to interact with hardware (keyboard, screen, memory, etc.).

        That makes the app very large, hard to manage, and bug-prone.

        b. One App Can Use Everything
        One app could take all the CPU, memory, or disk, and no one would stop it.

        Other apps wouldn’t get a chance to run.

        c. No Memory Protection
        One app could accidentally (or purposely) overwrite another app’s memory.

        That could crash the system or lead to security problems.

    2. What is an OS Made Of?
        An OS is a collection of system software that:

        Talks to the hardware (like CPU, memory, disk).

        Helps apps run safely and efficiently.

        Acts as a middleman between user, apps, and hardware.

        🎯 Main Functions of an Operating System
        Let’s look at what the OS actually does:

        ✅ 1. Access to Hardware
        It gives controlled access to hardware like memory, CPU, keyboard, and screen.

        ✅ 2. User Interface
        OS provides CLI (like terminal) or GUI (like Windows or macOS) so users can interact with the computer.

        ✅ 3. Resource Management (Arbitration)
        It decides:

        Which app gets how much memory

        Which process runs on CPU

        Who can access the printer, disk, etc.

        Prevents one app from hogging everything.

        ✅ 4. Abstraction (Hides Complexity)
        The OS hides hardware details from apps.

        Example: When an app wants to save a file, it just tells the OS — the OS takes care of where and how on the disk.

        ✅ 5. Isolation and Protection
        Each app runs in its own space (sandbox).

        OS ensures one app can’t affect others — adds security and stability.
