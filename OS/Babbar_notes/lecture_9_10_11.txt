✅ 1. What is a Program?
A program is just a set of instructions written by a programmer.
When it's compiled (converted into machine code), it's ready to run on the computer.

✅ 2. What is a Process?
A process is a program that is running in the computer's memory.
A program becomes a process when the OS (Operating System) starts running it.

✅ 3. How does OS create a process?
The OS performs these steps to start a process:

Loads the program and its static data (like constants) into memory.

Allocates a stack (used for function calls).

Allocates heap memory (used when you create new objects).

Handles I/O tasks, like opening files if needed.

Gives control to the program's main() function so it starts running.

✅ 4. Architecture of a Process
A process has the following components:

Code section (actual instructions)

Data section (global/static variables)

Heap (dynamically allocated memory)

Stack (for function calls and local variables)

✅ 5. Attributes of a Process
These are things the OS uses to manage each process:

Process ID: A unique number to identify each process.

Process Table: A list that the OS uses to track all running processes.

Each row in the table is called a PCB (Process Control Block).

What’s inside a PCB?
Process ID

Process State (Running, Waiting, etc.)

Program Counter (where it left off)

CPU registers

Priority, etc.

✅ 6. PCB & Register Use
When a process is paused (like switching to another one), the OS saves the current CPU values (registers) in the PCB.

Later, when the process resumes, the OS loads those values back into the CPU — like pausing and resuming a video game.

📘 LEC-10: Process States & Queues
✅ 1. Process States
A process can be in one of these states:

New: Just created, not running yet.

Ready: Waiting for CPU.

Running: Actively being executed.

Waiting: Waiting for I/O (like keyboard input or file).

Terminated: Finished execution.

✅ 2. Process Queues
OS keeps different queues for different states:

a. Job Queue:
Stores new programs.

Stored in hard disk.

Picked by Long-Term Scheduler.

b. Ready Queue:
Stores processes ready to run.

Stored in main memory (RAM).

Picked by Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler).

c. Waiting Queue:
Stores processes waiting for some I/O.

✅ 3. Degree of Multi-programming
This means: How many processes are in memory at the same time.
It’s controlled by the Long-Term Scheduler.

✅ 4. Dispatcher
It is a small program in the OS that gives the CPU to the process chosen by the CPU Scheduler.

📘 LEC-11: Swapping, Context Switch, Orphan & Zombie
✅ 1. Swapping
When memory is full, the OS can remove (swap out) a process from RAM to hard disk.

Later, it can bring it back (swap in) to resume execution.
This helps manage memory better.

✅ 2. Context Switching
When OS moves the CPU from one process to another:

It saves the current process info in its PCB.

Then it loads the next process info from its PCB.

Think of it like saving a paused game and loading another one.

This switching takes time and doesn't do real work — it's just overhead.

✅ 3. Orphan Process
If a parent process ends, but the child process is still running, it becomes an orphan.

These are taken care of by a special process called init.

✅ 4. Zombie Process
When a process finishes running but its entry is still in the process table, it becomes a zombie.

Why?

Because the parent process hasn't read the child's exit status yet.

Once the parent reads it using wait(), the OS removes the zombie from the table.
