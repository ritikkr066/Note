1. Stack came to mind because it naturally follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) – which is perfect for reversing sequences.

2. Pop words from the stack one by one and append to the final result in reversed order.

3. This approach is more space-efficient because we’re not storing intermediate data in a stack.

4. I preferred top-down DP with recursion because it’s intuitive to implement and easier to debug compared to iterative table-filling in bottom-up DP.

5. my approach is based on mapping each Roman character to its integer value and then iterating the string from right to left.

6.  I create a Map<Character, Integer> to store Roman symbols like 'I', 'V', 'X', etc., with their respective values — for example, 'I' is 1, 'V' is 5, and so on.
